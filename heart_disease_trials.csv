Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a group of structural differences to the heart that represent the most common birth defect among liveborn infants world-wide. CHD is the leading cause of birth-defect associated infant death. Prenatal detection allows for delivery planning, postnatal repair, specialized medications, and detailed counseling for parents. Up to one in three fetuses with CHD may have a genetic cause. In babies, knowing about genetic diseases helps patients and doctors provide the best care for their babies. If identified prenatally, this same knowledge may help participants prepare for their location of delivery, meet with specialists, and consider specialized treatments and medications that may be appropriate.

The diagnostic yield and clinical utility of whole genome sequencing (WGS) in fetuses with prenatally detected congenital heart disease (CHD) will be compared to routine clinical testing in patients choosing amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. DNA will be obtained from fetal samples and biological parent blood samples and analyzed according to standard clinical interpretation guidelines. Results will be reported to healthcare providers and patients and measures of clinical utility will be collected. Additionally, measures of stress, anxiety, depression, and perceived utility of information will be assessed by validated survey tools.

* What are the factors that affect families' adherence to the prophylaxis program and whether and how the effects of interventions depend on these factors?

To study these questions investigators planned to utilize four well-established cognitive biases in designing two alternative nudge-interventions and investigators measured the effectiveness of each nudge-intervention against a control group.

Patients were randomly allocated to one control and two treatment groups. In the control group, investigators informed participants about the prophylaxis program and provided a schedule. Patients in the first treatment group were additionally called two days before appointments (status quo bias), and were asked to plan the appointment day (implementation intention).

The use of ICD (implantable cardio-defibrillator) could prevent sudden death, however, the occurrence of repetitive shock decreases significantly the quality of life and could increase the mortality rate. Chagas disease in our environment is the most common heart disease and often associated with the occurrence appropriate ICD therapies.

The chronic treatment of VT aims to prevent recurrences with the use of antiarrhythmic drugs and catheter ablation, but in many cases, these treatments are insufficient to control the VT. Cardiac Sympathetic Denervation by bilateral sympathectomy has been described as an alternative treatment of VT refractory to medical treatment and radiofrequency ablation, especially in patients with channelopathies.

* left heart dysfunction with LVEF \< 30%.
* an ineffective cough
* presence of resuscitation neuromyopathy
* mechanical ventilation time \>7 days
* presence of a delirium
* age \>65 years old
* abundant bronchial secretion
* presence of underlying lung pathology An ineffective cough is found in 40% of patients requiring reintubation. However, cough assessment is most often approximate, based on a subjective assessment of cough strength by asking the patient to cough spontaneously on his or her tube).

The objective evaluation of cough is based on the measurement of the peak expiratory flow rate at cough, commonly referred to as peak expiratory flow rate at cough (PEFD), the patient is asked to take a deep breath and then cough as hard as possible.

Subjective cough assessment does not predict the occurrence of ventilatory withdrawal failure. Conversely, all studies that objectively assessed the strength of cough before extubation by measuring the PEFD found a significant association with the outcome of extubation: a low PEFD increases the risk of extubation failure by a factor of 5 to 9.

The investigators hypothesize that the increase in parietal abdominal muscle contraction obtained by using a non-invasive ultrasound method indicates an effective cough. Conversely, an ineffective cough can be detected by this simple ultrasound criterion, which can be performed at the patient's bedside and extrapolated to all intensive care units equipped with an ultrasound scanner. This evaluation will be carried out before extubation: during the spontaneous ventilation test on a tube in a half-seated position (\>45°) and within 24 hours after extubation.",44,"* Major patients admitted for intubated resuscitation, ventilated after sternotomy cardiac surgery and having a mechanical ventilation time of less than 48 hours.","* Pregnant patient * Recent history of stroke(\<6 months ) * Minor patient * Neurological disorder (Alzheimer's disease, delirium, confusion) * Emphysemal patient",False,ALL,18 Years,100 Years,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,France,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Centre Chirurgical Marie Lannelongue,OTHER

It is practiced worldwide and is a prominent discipline in many mixed martial arts (MMA) training camps. In this sport, training load control involves monitoring and adjusting the quantity and intensity of training according to each athlete's capacity. In the context of combat sports, such as Muay Thai, heart rate variability (HRV) and assessment of body composition by bioelectrical impedance analysis can be used as tools to evaluate training responses. Additionally, HRV can also serve as a tool for assessing recovery after training or competition. If HRV does not return to baseline after training or competition, it may be a sign that the athlete is not fully recovered and may need more time to recuperate before returning to training or competition. Due to the absence of studies in the literature that have assessed a possible association between HRV and dehydration and rehydration processes in amateur Muay Thai athletes, it becomes essential to evaluate this correlation. Given the growing interest in practicing Muay Thai in gyms, assessing the sympathetic-vagal balance, body composition, and performance of these athletes becomes of utmost importance.

Medicines for Afib work by blocking a current in the heart called a potassium current. There is a newer potassium current called IKas that can contribute to Afib. A medicine called ondansetron is used to keep people with cancer from getting sick to their stomach and throwing up. The investigators have found that ondansetron blocks IKas, and the investigators think that this means that ondansetron may work well to treat Afib. So, in this study the investigators want to find out if ondansetron can: 1) Reduce the amount of time that people have Afib, and 2) Slow down the heart rate when people have Afib. The investigators will study 80 people who are scheduled to have an AF ablation. Several weeks prior to undergoing the ablation procedure, these AF patients will be assigned by chance (like flipping a coin) to one of two groups: ondansetron 8 mg by mouth twice daily or a sugar pill (placebo), which they will take for 28 days. The people in the study will not know whether they are receiving ondansetron or placebo. The investigators will find out if ondansetron reduces the percentage of time that people are in Afib. Also, the investigators will find out if ondansetron slows the heart rate while people are having Afib. The investigators will compare the people in the study who take ondansetron with the people in the study who take placebo. This research will help the investigators to find out if ondansetron can be used as a medicine for people who have Afib.",80,"* Men and women 18-100 years of age * ECG-verified AF and/or atrial flutter requiring elective catheter ablation * Receiving guideline-recommended anticoagulation (if CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0 (men) or 1 (women), anticoagulation can be omitted)","* Women of childbearing potential * Subject reported syncope of unknown origin within the previous 6 months * Diagnosis of active thyrotoxicosis * Diagnosis AF from reversible noncardiac causes * Diagnosis of acutely decompensated heart failure * Left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 20% * New York Heart Association class IV heart failure * Diagnosis of severe liver disease (Child-Pugh score greater than or equal to 10) * Cardiac surgery (preceding 2 months) * Not receiving anticoagulation due to contraindications (as determined by treating physician and recorded in the medical record) * Pretreatment QRS \> 180 ms, QTc \> 450 ms within two weeks of screening visit * Heart rate \< 50 beats per minute in SR * Diagnosis of hypotension * Diagnosis of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome * Previous ondansetron hypersensitivity or serotonin syndrome * Diagnosis of phenylketonuria * Diagnosis of congenital long QT syndrome * Concomitant therapy with both beta-blockers and a nondihydropyridine CCB * History of drug-induced torsades de pointes or QTc prolongation * Concomitant therapy with QTc-prolonging medications (www.crediblemeds.org), except amiodarone and propafenone * Concomitant therapy with serotonergic drugs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, lithium, tramadol), apomorphine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, rifampin. * Left ventricular ejection fraction \< 20% and those with NYHA class IV heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (confirmed by diagnosis or echocardiogram within 6 months of enrollment in screening) * Patients with pre-existing allergies to adhesives * Patients with neuromuscular stimulators",False,ALL,18 Years,100 Years,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,United States,"James E Tisdale, PharmD",CONTACT,317-880-5418,jtisdale@purdue.edu,Indiana University,N/A

However, β-blocker therapy remains underutilized in clinical practice because of concerns of potential adverse effects such as a reduced inotropic state, which might result in acute congestive heart failure or hypotension. Therefore, additional treatment with a positive inotropic agent might be needed. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDEIs) offer a favourable pharmacological profile in this setting and stimulate cardiac function in the absence of the β-adrenergic receptor.

We hypothesize that the combination of PDEI and β-blocker therapy would decrease perioperative plasma concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in patients requiring major vascular surgery.

In the past, studies have shown that a blood thinner (warfarin) can decrease the risk of stroke and clot formation if administered to patients after an anterior myocardial infarction.

However, in today's current practice, certain heart attack patients are commonly treated with two blood-thinning medications (aspirin and clopidogrel) to prevent recurrent heart attacks.

Thus, a clinical problem is created as physicians are not clear how to treat patients after an anterior myocardial infarction who are at risk of a clot but require aspirin and clopidogrel to keep their blood vessels open. Adding warfarin to the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel will possibly decrease the risk of stroke but increase the risk of bleeding. Currently, there is no good evidence to help guide physicians. As demonstrated by a survey done at the Hamilton Health Sciences, there is a fifty/fifty split between physicians who use dual (aspirin and clopidogrel) versus triple (aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin) therapy in the treatment of similar patients as described above.

Many studies suggest using vitamin C as an additional treatment alongside standard therapies, such as statins and β-blockers, to reduce the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) in patients undergoing (CABG). Supplemental therapy with vitamin C may provide a more robust preventive effect against POAF compared to using statins and β-blockers due to its strong antioxidant effect. This implies that vitamin C can enhance the effectiveness of those medications used for POAF prevention by decreasing oxidative stress induced by the surgery.

There are conflicting data on whether or not vitamin C as an antioxidant has a protective effect against postoperative atrial fibrillation and has a significant role in shortening length of ICU and hospital stay . Even in those studies that show positive relationship of vitamin C in AF prevention, there is a diversity in the dosing regimen of vitamin C used among those previous studies.

To the best of our knowledge, most researches were conducted predominantly within a single geographic region, such as Iran, this raises the concerns about the potential bias and limits our ability to apply the findings to a broader global population.

The only treatment available is Aortic Valve Replacement (AVR) performed by surgery or by catheterization (TAVI).

Once a diagnosis has been made and the decision to treat these patients has been taken, the procedure (AVR or TAVI) must be performed rapidly given the poor prognosis of the disease without treatment. Studies have shown that on the waiting list, the probability of death and hospitalisation for heart failure increases with time. This delay could also reduce the effectiveness of TAVI, thus affecting the performance of the healthcare system.

Cardiac metabolic parameters, including myocardial steatosis and epicardial fat, are altered in diabetic patients. The development of new anti-diabetics (incretins) has demonstrated protective cardiovascular effects independent of effects on glycemic control for the first time in the history of these therapies.

In most cases, dobutamine is administered routinely, for the probable occurrence of myocardial dysfunction after cardiopulmonary bypass or a low cardiac output with minimal evidence of altered tissue perfusion.

Recent data show that inotropic agents are used in 35-52% of cardiac surgeries in the perioperative period. However, the use of inotropic agents may be associated with adverse events, including myocardial ischemia, by elevation in myocardial oxygen consumption and the imbalance between supply and consumption, and tachyarrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, sinus tachycardia, ventricular tachyarrhythmias), primarily due to the β1-adrenergic effect.

This study is a non-inferiority clinical randomized study aiming to compare the use of dobutamine in a liberal strategy (in all patients at the time of withdrawal of CPB) with a restrictive strategy (based on clinical and hemodynamic evidence of low cardiac output syndrome associated with altered tissue perfusion).

To improve cardiometabolic health, effective and individualized interventions are crucial. Psychosis outpatient clinics are ideal for these interventions due to regular patient visits and the availability of diverse health professionals. The investigators have developed and want to test a comprehensive intervention program to improve cardiometabolic health, enhance quality of life, and promote healthy lifestyles specifically for people with psychotic disorders at psychiatric outpatient clinics in Gothenburg.

This clinical trial aims to include 644 individuals with psychotic disorders from six outpatient clinics in the Department of Psychotic Disorders at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg. Two outpatient clinics will provide the LAGOM-intervention, while the other clinics will serve as controls, offering ""care as usual"". The intervention group will receive multidisciplinary support integrated into the routine clinical procedures. The intervention includes regular follow-ups and use of motivational tools, including body composition analyzer and cardiovascular risk prediction algorithm (QRISK3).

During this process the patient´s circulation is controlled by a bypass machine which provides several functions:

1. Controls the patient's blood flow by pumping of blood in the patient's body.
2. Controls the correct oxygen levels in the patient's blood.
3. Regulates the temperature and fluid level of the blood. This process triggers negative responses in the heart and throughout the whole body, potentially resulting in injury to the heart and other organs such as brain, kidneys and lungs.

Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) describes a procedure that could potentially reduce the injury to heart muscle during cardiac surgery. The procedure consists of the inflation of a blood pressure cuff on the child's leg for three 5 minute cycles. This process acts by briefly reducing blood flow to the leg muscle, which will then activate the body´s own protective mechanisms and thereby reduce heart injury.

Several animal studies have been used to help the understanding of the mechanisms behind this process, and trials in human adults have showed optimistic results; however evidence regarding the paediatric population is limited and necessary since children present different basal profiles, risks and requirements.

The investigators propose a randomized clinical trial assessing the efficacy of RIPC to provide protection against injury to the heart and other organs in children going through cardiac surgery using CPB at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The research project will have a translational approach, integrating basic molecular mechanisms to clinical outcome. The investigators hope it will allow the understanding and utilisation of the patient´s own protective mechanisms, reducing CPB-related injury and ultimately improving patient outcome.",51,"* Children undergoing cardiac surgery for correction of congenital heart defects utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass and cold blood cardioplegia strategy of myocardial protection. * Children whose parents understand the child's condition, the purpose of the study and are willing to participate.","* Children whose parents either are unwilling or do not have sufficient understanding of the study. * Emergency operations, where there is insufficient time to establish the study protocol. * Premature children presenting a corrected gestational age under 35 weeks. * Presence of extracardiac abnormalities, apart from cases of Down and DiGeorge syndromes which will be included. * Patients with known viral blood infections (e.g. HIV, Hepatitis B) or severe congenital infection. * Patients with severe preoperative brain injury.",False,ALL,2 Days,16 Years,CHILD,United Kingdom,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde,OTHER

Its prevalence ranges between 2-4% worldwide. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. One of the main concerns of AF is the risk of thromboembolism, which can result in debilitating or detrimental stroke. The gold standard for preventing AF stroke is long term oral anticoagulation in the form of warfarin or NOAC1,2.

Around 50% of patients who need anticoagulation are not on any form tablets and about 5% of patients who are not anticoagulated developed stroke. Some patients could not take anticoagulation because of high risk of bleeding, and this result in challenges within this cohort of patients. The left atrial appendage (LAA) is believed to be the main source of embolic in atrial fibrillation. The LAA is an anterolateral structure which is the smallest part of the left atrium. It originates anterior from the left pulmonary vein ostium. More than 90% of thromboembolic events happened in the LAA of non-rheumatic patients whereas only 57% of thrombi in rheumatic mitral valve disease3. This suggests that occluding the LAA is more beneficial in the non-valvular AF patients. Incomplete LAA closure is associated with a higher occurrence of thromboembolism. The growing evidence of LAA occlusion has been emerged. Percutaneous LAA Occlusion (LAAO) has been suggested that it may be considered for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and contraindication for long term anticoagulation (class IIB, level B)1,2. This recommendation is based on the randomized controlled trials to show that percutaneous devices are non-inferior to oral anticoagulation in terms of preventing stroke in AF patients.

Surgical LAA clip occlusion (LAAC) has emerged as a potential method to isolate LAA to prevent thromboembolism. The recent LAAOS III trial shows that the risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism was lower with concomitant left atrial appendage occlusion performed during the surgery than without it, most of whom continued to receive ongoing anticoagulant therapy4. This reinforced the mechanistic value of occluding the LAA in prevention of stroke. However, the efficacy of isolated LAAC without anticoagulation is uncertain. Besides, as this surgical clip occlusion is frequently performed together with other concomitant cardiac surgery, post evaluation in the form of imaging is lacking. Our study aims to study the imaging follow-up result and clinical efficacy of surgical and percutaneous left atrial appendage closure.",260,* Atrial fibrillation diagnosis * Underwent LAA clip (Atriclip) or left atrial appendage occlusion with CHADVASC \>=2,* Subject not required anticoagulation due to low CHADVASC * Mechanical valve replacement * Tissue mitral valve replacement or tissue aortic valve replacement with underlying chronic rheumatic heart disease,False,ALL,19 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Chinese University of Hong Kong,OTHER

Some people have a condition in which the wall (septum) that separates the two main pumping chambers of the heart is too thick. This thick septum causes a condition called ""left ventricular outflow tract obstruction"" (LVOTO), which reduces blood flow out of the heart. LVOTO can cause serious heart disease; symptoms may include shortness of breath, chest pain, heart failure, or death. Researchers want to find better ways to treat LVOTO.

Objective:

To test a new procedure where excess tissue is sliced away from the septum in people with LVOTO. This procedure is called ""septal scoring along midline endocardium"" (SESAME).

Eligibility:

Adults aged 21 years with LVOTO.

Design:

Participants will have baseline tests. They will have imaging scans and tests of their heart structure and function. They will take a walking test and answer questions about how their heart condition affects their life.

Participants will stay in the hospital 2 to 6 days for the SESAME procedure.

They will be completely or partially asleep for the procedure. A tube will be inserted into the mouth and down the throat to take pictures of the heart. Pictures may also be taken with a tube inserted inside the heart.

Next, tubes will be inserted into the groin and guided through the blood vessels up to the heart. Guidewires will be inserted into the heart. Doctors will watch the path the wires take with x-rays and ultrasound. When the wire is in the correct place, it will be electrified to slice excess tissue away from the septum.

A summary of the rationale for this study is as follows:

1. Recently completed randomized trials of cardiac monitoring following stroke have established that PAF is more common than previously recognized in cryptogenic stroke.
2. The majority of TIA/stroke patients will have at least one potential stroke mechanism identified by the time etiologic investigations completed.
3. Detecting PAF in patients with strokes with known causes (eg. lacunar and large vessel atherosclerosis) is clinically important since appropriate anticoagulation for AF reduces stroke recurrence in all patients with prior TIA/stroke not just cryptogenic strokes.
4. There are competing technologies for evaluating cardiac rhythm and diagnosing AF but no cost effectiveness data
5. The rates of PAF in strokes with known causes (SKC) have not been well characterized.

PER-DIEM is a pilot study to compare two different cardiac monitoring technologies as first-line investigations to detect PAF in patients with recent stroke and TIA. The study will also assess whether a pivotal trial is feasible and warranted.

The principal research questions to be addressed in this study will be:

1. Whether implantable loop recorder (ILR) plus remote monitoring will diagnose more paroxysmal AF / atrial flutter and provide a better assessment of the total burden of AF resulting in a greater proportion of patients started on an OAC versus the external loop recorder (ELR) strategy.
2. What is the relative cost-effectiveness as a first-line investigation of long-term implantable ECG (ILR) coupled with remote monitoring for 12 months compared to external event-triggered ECG loop recorder (ELR) for 30 days in the diagnosis clinically actionable AF in following TIA/stroke.

Approximately half of all adults living with heart failure have a form where the heart stiffens, which impairs its ability to fill. This form of heart failure particularly affects females and older adults. When people exercise, extra blood returns to the heart. The healthy heart can easily fill and move this extra blood to the muscles. However, when the heart's ability to fill is impaired, the extra blood can back up and pool in the lungs. Blood pooling in the lungs makes people feel breathless, although the investigators do not fully understand why, and this form of heart failure has a high risk of hospitalization and death, but few effective treatments are available. Exercise is one of the few treatments that works well if enough exercise is performed regularly. However, many people with this form of heart failure can only tolerate a small amount before stopping due to severe breathlessness, which can put them off from exercising regularly.

The study's goal is to help these people perform more exercise. The investigators will use a novel form of stationary cycling with a plastic chamber around the lower body that seals at the waist. The chamber can apply suction to the lower body during exercise which will reduce how much extra blood returns and prevent the heart and lungs from being overloaded. Participants will attend 5 visits, including 3 where they will perform a submaximal exercise test for as many minutes as possible with or without light suction. In each of these tests, the investigators will record how long they exercise and ask them to rate how breathless they feel.

CE is associated with worse clinical outcomes than traditional atherosclerotic AMI, showing increased rates of cardiac death and cerebrovascular events. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the primary underlying cause of CE, cited in 28%-73% of cases across large series. Despite AF's central role, comprehensive data detailing the clinical, biochemical, echocardiographic, angiographic characteristics, and outcomes of CE specifically linked to AF remains limited. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by retrospectively evaluating patients with AF-related CE (AF CE) and non-AF CE, characterizing their differences and identifying outcome predictors.

Methods From January 2008 to Dicember 2024, consecutive patients admitted to a tertiary care cardiology unit and meeting both the Fourth Universal Definition of AMI and either definite or probable CE per Shibata's criteria were retrospectively included. Shibata's classification involves major and minor angiographic and clinical criteria to establish the likelihood of CE. Definite CE is diagnosed with a combination of major and minor criteria, while probable CE requires fewer criteria. Cases with evidence of atherosclerotic thrombus, prior revascularization, coronary anomalies like ectasia, spontaneous coronary artery dissection, or stress cardiomyopathy were excluded.

Coronary Embolism Definition

The Shibata criteria define CE based on:

Major criteria: angiographic embolism signs unrelated to atherosclerosis, multisite CE, systemic embolism excluding left ventricular thrombus from STEMI.

Minor criteria: non-significant coronary stenosis (\<25%), embolic source identified by imaging, and risk factors like AF, dilated cardiomyopathy, rheumatic valve disease, prosthetic valves, recent cardiac surgery, coagulation disorders, patent foramen ovale, or atrial septal defect.

Coronary Arteriography All patients underwent invasive coronary angiography, independently reviewed by two specialists. Stenoses were visually assessed according to recognized grading systems.

Echocardiography Transthoracic echocardiography was performed following contemporary guidelines, evaluating left atrial and ventricular size and function, and left atrial strain using speckle tracking with standardized software (Philips).

Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) CMR was performed in patients initially diagnosed with MINOCA (Myocardial Infarction with Non-Obstructive Coronary Arteries) based on standard protocols, evaluating for subendocardial or transmural late gadolinium enhancement and focal myocardial edema to support CE diagnosis.

Atrial Fibrillation Definition AF was diagnosed as per ESC guidelines, requiring over 30 seconds of rhythm without P waves and irregular RR intervals. Both history of AF and new-onset AF during hospitalization or follow-up qualified for classification into the AF CE group.

Outcomes

Two types of outcomes were evaluated:

In-hospital outcomes: composite of heart failure, cardiogenic shock, ventricular arrhythmias, stroke, or death.

Long-term outcomes: composite of reinfarction, systemic embolism, stroke, cardiac or all-cause mortality.

Ethics The study protocol was approved by an independent ethics committee, with a waiver of informed consent, justified under the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (reference n° 3318-0000257).

Statistical Analysis Categorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages, continuous variables as means ± standard deviations. AF CE and non-AF CE groups were compared using Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for qualitative variables, and parametric or non-parametric tests for quantitative variables depending on distribution normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). For in-hospital outcomes, univariable logistic regression was performed to identify associated variables, followed by multivariable stepwise forward logistic regression for variables with p \< 0.1. Long-term outcomes were assessed using univariable Cox regression and multivariable stepwise forward Cox regression for significant variables. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and log-rank tests evaluated long-term outcome differences.

Patients treated with warfarin, an oral anti-coagulant, require frequent lab monitoring and dose adjustments and are managed in pharmacy staffed anti-coagulation clinics that routinely contact them to remind them about blood draws, re-enforce medication adherence, and adjust dosing based on labs.

Dabigatran, a newly approved medication that may be better for some with atrial fibrillation to lower risk of stroke and clotting, has been found to have fewer drug problems and eliminates lab monitoring need. Following instructions for taking dabigatran is important because it is a twice daily medication requiring monthly refills. Rivaroxaban is a once daily, newly approved Factor Xa inhibitor oral medication, prescribed to reduce risk of stroke and systemic embolism among patients with atrial fibrillation. Apixaban is a twice daily, FDA approved Factor Xa inhibitor oral anticoagulant, prescribed to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots among patients with atrial fibrillation. In a double-blind RCT, apixaban was found to be superior to warfarin in reducing stroke, systemic embolism, and death. Patients on dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban will not be followed in anti-coagulation clinics, therefore will not benefit from the support provided by these clinics.

It's anticipated many patients will be switched to dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban following recent publication of criteria for dabigatran use from the VA National Pharmacy Benefits Management Program, providing an opportune time to conduct the proposed adherence study. We will conduct qualitative interviews with patients(n\~30) and pharmacists(n\~20) to understand barriers/facilitators to oral anticoagulant adherence. Informed by the findings, we will develop and pilot test a multi faceted intervention to improve adherence among patients recently started on dabigatran/rivaroxaban/apixaban.

1. Conduct interviews with a sample of patients (n=30) recently started on dabigatran for atrial fibrillation to determine why patients do or don't take medications
2. Conduct interviews with pharmacists (n=20) in anti-coagulation clinics in order to understand their opinions why patients do or don't take medications

In cases where cardiomyopathy does not respond to guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure, the disease may progress to a stage where heart transplantation is the only viable treatment option. According to the 2022 Korean Organ Transplant Registry (KOTRY) report, cardiomyopathy accounted for approximately 65% of heart transplant indications in Korea, making it one of the most challenging unresolved issues in modern cardiology. Furthermore, cardiomyopathy is associated with a high risk of sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardi and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are often recommended as a preventive measure. Given that sudden cardiac death frequently occurs in young and middle-aged individuals, it is a major public health concern in developed countries such as North America and Western/Northern Europe, prompting ongoing societal and medical efforts to reduce its burden. The risk of sudden cardiac death imposes a persistent psychological burden on family members of patients with cardiomyopathy. Because sudden death can also occur in children and adolescents, current clinical guidelines recommend early cardiac evaluation and genetic counseling for family members of affected individuals.

This study seeks to overcome the current limitations in the genetic diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, including the low diagnostic yield of currently available gene panels. To date, most genetic data on cardiomyopathy have been derived from Western populations. There is a significant lack of population-specific genomic data for East Asians, particularly Koreans, making it difficult to interpret the results of genetic testing in Korean patients.

By developing bioinformatics algorithms that comprehensively analyze whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions/deletions (indels), and structural variations, this study aims to generate a reference dataset tailored to the Korean population. This will directly improve the genetic diagnosis of cardiomyopathy in Korean patients. Additionally, by identifying novel pathogenic variants through WGS, this study may elucidate new disease mechanisms underlying cardiomyopathy. These findings could provide a theoretical basis for developing novel diagnostic biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and even gene-based therapies. The present study is part of a multi-phase national research project supported by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency and the Korea National Institute of Health, conducted as a registry cohort titled the """"Korean Cardiomyopathy Cohort (KCC)"""".

Objectives This study aims to establish a diagnostic research framework to elucidate the genetic architecture of rare inherited cardiomyopathies through comprehensive analysis of whole genome sequencing data, with the goal of identifying novel diagnostic approaches",560,"-Patients with a family history of genetic cardiomyopathy, defined as having at least one first-degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) diagnosed with the same type of cardiomyopathy, confirming a familial genetic pattern.","* Patients with confirmed ischemic cardiomyopathy (when stenosis of 75% or more of major coronary arteries is confirmed on coronary artery imaging or ischemic cardiomyopathy findings such as transmural LGE on cardiac MRI) * Heart failure with other etiologies (e.g., valvular heart disease, endocrine disease)",False,ALL,19 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,"Korea, Republic of","Jaewon Oh, M.D. Ph.D.",CONTACT,N/A,ericjcoh@yuhs.ac,Yonsei University,N/A

NeoLifeS-Heart is a sub-study that focuses on the problem that a high proportion of preterm infants develop cardiovascular disorders. Related to the immaturity of their lungs, preterm infants are at risk to develop the condition Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Also, the vasculature of the lungs is often not fully developed, making them more vulnerable for the development of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH), a high blood pressure in the lungs. 15-20% of the infants with extremely low birth weight are believed to develop PH, this proportion has been suggested to raise to 50% in infants with severe BPD. The presence of PH significantly worsens the prognosis and survival of these children.

The condition PH is insufficiently characterized. Knowledge of incidence, prevalence, risk factors for the development of PH and survival, will be the first step in improving detection strategies, possible treatment options and thereby prognosis and survival of these children.

Objective: To determine the incidence and prevalence of PH in preterm infants. In addition we aim to identify risk factors for the development of PH and determine the survival and prognosis of these preterm infants.

In addition to its prognostic value, hyponatremia may have importance during the acute management of HF.

Its occurrence may worsen significantly the outcome as previously reported. It is therefore of parmount importance to prevent such an adverse effect.

The investigators hypothesize that a decrease in the central venous oxygen saturation (SvcO2) measured related to a decreased cardiac output could precede the onset of IDH. The aim of this study is collect IDH in AKI patients and to measure continuously SvcO2 during RRT session in order to investigate its role in predicting IDH.",100,"* Critically ill patients requiring blood pressure monitoring * Severe AKI treated by RRT * Hemodynamic stability prior to initiation of RRT * Patients aged above 18 years * Patient is not beneficiary or affiliated with a social security plan * Contraindication to placement of a venous catheter in the superior vena cava territory: thrombosis of the superior vena cava, thrombosis of the jugular and subclavian veins * Chronic end-stage renal failure on chronic dialysis",* Pregnancy * Major under tutorship or curatorship,False,ALL,18 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,France,"Eddine BENDIAB, Dr",CONTACT,0467332495,e-bendiab@chu-montpellier.fr,"University Hospital, Montpellier",N/A
NCT01979744,Intravascular ULTrasound Guided Versus Conventional Angiography Guided Strategy to Deploy Zotarolimus and Everolimus Eluting Third Generation Stents in the Long Coronary Artery Lesions: ULTRA-ZET Trial,N/A,COMPLETED,2013-10,2017-10-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,Coronary Artery Disease,IVUS guided percutaneous coronary angioplasty with Resolute integrity stent insertion; Angiography guided percutaneous coronary angioplasty with Resolute integrity stent insertion; Angiography guided percutaneous coronary angioplasty with Promus element stent implantation; Angiography guided percutaneous coronary angioplasty with Promus element stent implantation,Efficacy of angiography or IVUS guided third generation stent implantation,"Although first generation DES reduced instent restenosis, still remained the unsolved problems such as stent thrombosis and restenosis in the era of DES. Second generation DES had been developed to improve the biocompatibility of stent coating focused on polymer compared to first generation DES, so that second generation stents showed better outcomes compared with first generation DES. On the other hands, in third generation DES, further refinement of DES involved more flexible stent platform. Promus ElementTM (Everolimus eluting stent, Boston Scientific, Nastick, MA) and Resolute Integrity® (Zotarolimus eluting stent, Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, CA) are the third generation drug eluting stents which are designed to increase flexibility. In previous randomized controlled studies, both of these stents have shown at least non-inferior angiographic and clinical outcomes compared to second generation DES. However, there is lack of data about comparison of angiographic and clinical outcomes between Promus ElementTM and Resolute Integrity®.

IVUS is one of the widely used intracoronary imaging devices to provide more reproducible and accurate information about coronary anatomy than angiography in current practice.8 Optimal stent expansion assessed by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has been reported as an important factor to prevent stent thrombosis or restenosis.9 Accordingly, there have been many studies to evaluate the procedural or clinical benefit of IVUS guided angioplasty. However, The clinical benefit of IVUS-guided angioplasty with stent implantation is still in a controversy. In the previous studies, IVUS-guided stent implantation showed positive or negative beneficial effect on clinical outcomes according to their study subjects. However, the stents used in the previous studies are less useful in current practice of cardiology and there is lack of data of 3rd generation DES, which have different stent profiles and outcomes with their predecessors.

Thus we would perform a prospective randomized study in order to compare the efficacy of IVUS-guided angioplasty with conventional angioplasty-guided procedure in the long coronary lesion. Our main hypothesis is IVUS-guided 3rd generation DES implantation in the long coronary lesions would have better clinical outcomes compared with conventional angiography-guided strategy. We also intend to assess the clinical outcomes after Promus ElementTM and Resolute Integrity® implantation.",568,* Patients ≥ 19 years old * Coronary artery disease and lesions which are candidate for treatment with drug eluting stent according to current clinical practice guidelines * PCI for lesion(s) which needs a stent of 26mm or more * Reference diameter from 2.25 to 4.0mm,* Restenosis lesion * Reference vessel diameter \< 2.25 mm or \> 4.0mm * Primary PCI for STEMI * Contraindication to anti-platelet agents * Treated with any DES within 3 months at other vessel * Severe hepatic dysfunction (3 times normal reference values) * Pregnant women or women with potential childbearing * Life expectancy \< 1 year,False,ALL,19 Years,85 Years,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,"Korea, Republic of",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Yonsei University,OTHER

The primary hypotheses are that delayed reperfusion therapy for suspected STEMI independently relates to provider practice patterns and system barriers. It is further postulated that non-compliance with target delays in implementing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or fibrinolytic therapy is associated with worse in-hospital clinical outcomes. The secondary hypotheses are that the delivery of acute reperfusion therapy within target delays is associated with increased rates of false-positive cardiac catheterization laboratory activation, inadvertent fibrinolytic therapy, and bleeding events.

Nearly 400,000 people in England suffer from epilepsy. About 40% of these patients are known to have seizures predominantly in sleep. All seizures pose risk to the individual both physical and psychological. Nocturnal seizures pose extra risk as the diagnosis may be missed or delayed. Patients with nocturnal seizures are also thought to be at particular risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), especially if their seizures are unobserved. In patients with poor seizure control, the risk of SUDEP has been found to be as high as 9 per 1,000 patient years. Previous studies show that many seizures are associated with changes in the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) tone. The ANS tone can be assessed using heart rate variability parameters (HRV). A few studies suggest that ANS tone changes tend to precede the onset of epileptic seizure related surface electroencephalographic (EEG) changes, suggesting that ANS tone changes could be used in seizure alarm or intervention systems. This prospective study intends to focus on seizures from sleep and study HRV parameters in the immediate preictal state of the seizure and compare these with resting HRV parameters in the same patient with the aim of finding HRV metrics which could help to identify the presence of seizures in longterm electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings, or help predict seizure occurrence, or provide information about the current risk of seizures.

Although cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an effective modality that reduces the risk for death, hospital readmissions and improves the quality of life (QoL), only a third of the patients participate in CR. The association between individual nutrients and dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) have been shown to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and mortality. Every 1-point increase in Mediterranean diet score is associated with a 12% decrease in mortality. Although physical activity and nutrition counseling are core components of CR, less than a third of remote CR programs provide nutrition counseling. In the current study, we aim to compare the effectiveness of remote, web-based nutrition counseling (WBNC) to standard in-person nutrition counseling (IPNC).

Methods: Patients one month or less from hospital discharge for MI, who are capable of conducting a conversation using Zoom software, will be eligible to participate. In a single-blind, controlled single-center study, a 1: 1 randomization will be performed for web-based nutrition counseling (WBNC) intervention or standard in-person nutrition counseling (IPNC). Patients from both groups will receive the usual CR program (medical follow-up and on-site physical activity). Interventions will be delivered at baseline, 45 days, and 90 days post-baseline. Follow-up assessments will be performed at 6 months. Patients will complete questionnaires for socioeconomic information, physical activity level, motivation to perform lifestyle changes, food intake, adherence to MedDiet and QoL. Anthropometric measures and handgrip strength will be obtained. Medical information, lipid profile and fasting glucose level will be obtained from patient's records. Calculated sample size: 90 patients to reject the null hypothesis (no difference in between-group adherence to MedDiet) with 80% power and a confidence interval of 95%.

Expected results: The effectiveness of WBNC on adherence to MedDiet, anthropometric measures, and Qol. Our findings will enable us to identify target populations for whom nutritional treatment using telemedicine will achieve optimal results.

The Fontan operation is performed for patients with single ventricle physiology as the final palliation to create a series circulation, with passive systemic venous return to the pulmonary arteries and the single ventricle solely providing systemic output.

Patients undergoing extracardiac Fontan tend to have elevation of Fontan pressures immediately following the operation with inflammation from surgery requiring additional fluid administration to maintain blood pressure. Increased Fontan pressures and fluid overload lead to prolonged chest tube drainage.

In this context, the analysis of the faecal microbiota before PCI, at hospital discharge and at follow-up, could be considered useful for identifying hyperglycaemic patients with alteration of metabolic-oxidative processes, and pro-thrombotic correlates with worse post procedural prognosis. Therefore, the analysis of faecal microbiota during the STEMI event could theoretically identify hyperglycemic patients with excessive inflammatory and oxidative tone caused by hyperglycemia, conditioning resistance to double anti-aggregation therapy and coronary stenting, and conditioning pro-thrombotic phenomena after coronary reperfusion by PCI. Therefore, authors will conduct a study to analyze the microbiota in patients with acute hyperglycaemic and normoglycemic coronary syndrome. The primary objective of this study will be to evaluate any changes in the microbiota and its activity on faecal material taken before PCI, and after 6 and 12 months in patients with hyperglycemic STEMI, and also evaluate if the changes in the microbiota can be related to the 12-month prognosis.",200,* aged \> 18 years * STEMI acute admission event,"* left ventricular ejection fraction \<25%, * previous acute myocardial infarction * previous percutaneous coronary intervention * previous coronary artery by-pass",N/A,ALL,18 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,Italy,"Raffaele Marfella, MD, PhD",CONTACT,+39 0815665110,raffaele.marfella@unicampania.it,University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli,N/A

Furthermore, abnormal glucose metabolism below the diagnostic threshold of diabetes mellitus is also associated with increased risk of death compared to patients with a normal glucose metabolism. The frequency of abnormal glucose metabolism in acute myocardial infarction is high, and approximately 70% of myocardial infarction patients have diabetes mellitus, newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance, leaving only 30% with normal glucose metabolism. The increased mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction and abnormal glucose metabolism seems mainly related to a higher occurrence of congestive heart failure, suggesting that an abnormal glucose metabolism may play an important role among others in endothelial dysfunction, infarct healing and overall left ventricle function. This raises the question, whether patients with acute myocardial infarction and abnormal glucose metabolism have increased frequency of micro- or macrovascular disease or both.

Coronary flow velocity reserve reflects the patency of the epicardial coronary artery in combination with vasodilator capacity of the microcirculation and may therefore offer a tool for assessment of macro- and microcirculation.

However, with the widespread use of genetic testing and high-sensitivity cardiac imaging in recent years, the estimated prevalence of HCM may be as high as 1 in 200. Approximately 75% of HCM patients will develop left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO), leading to decreased exercise capacity, dyspnea, syncope, heart failure, and even sudden death, significantly impacting the patients\&#39; quality of life and survival.

The optimal treatment for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is still a matter of controversy, despite surgical myectomy being considered the \&#34;gold standard\&#34; for HOCM treatment. Treatment options such as chemical (radiofrequency) ablation and medications (Mavacamten) are also challenging the status, and there is even debate over the surgical approach for myectomy. Currently, there is no consensus in the medical community about the pathophysiological mechanisms of LVOTO, and the exact mechanisms of its occurrence are not fully understood, which is also a major reason for the treatment controversy in HOCM patients.

The focus of clinical decision-making is on the treatment based on the LVOTO pressure gradient, and it is generally recommended internationally to consider invasive treatment when the LVOTO pressure gradient is ≥50mmHg. However, there are still a small number of patients who do not have symptoms with a pressure gradient greater than 50mmHg or have significant symptoms with a pressure gradient less than 50mmHg, indicating that relying solely on the pressure gradient to assess the severity of HOCM and its prognosis may not be comprehensive enough.

In recent years, with the development of medical engineering integration, the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in the medical field, particularly in the field of cardiovascular diseases, has become increasingly widespread. CFD can construct cardiovascular geometric models based on specific clinical images of a patient and simulate ventricular wall motion and blood flow within the heart through computer calculations to obtain the required hemodynamic parameters. This enables the visualization and quantification of intraventricular blood flow. Compared to direct measurement techniques based on imaging, CFD has advantages such as non-invasiveness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy, leading to its increasing application in cardiovascular function research. In particular, in the field of cardiomyopathy, CFD can help deepen the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy by reconstructing the anatomical configuration of the left ventricle and analyzing intraventricular blood flow and related hemodynamic parameters, which in turn can aid in clinical decision-making and the assessment of clinical prognosis. Therefore, we propose using three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) simulation technology to assess the hemodynamics of patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, in order to guide clinical decision-making.",200,* 1.

Secondary objective: The secondary objectives of the study are to determine if ICD therapy reduces sudden death.

Study design: Randomized, unblinded, controlled, parallel two group trial.

Primary endpoint: Time to death from any cause.

Sample size: In total, 1000 patients with 500 receiving ICD and 500 patients constituting the control group.

Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria: Patients with clinical heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%, non-ischemic etiology and NT-proBNP above 200 pg/ml. Patients in NYHA class IV will only be randomised if also fulfilling criteria for a biventricular pacemaker.

Control group: Patients receiving standard therapy for heart failure including ACE-inhibitor/Angiotensin-Receptor-Blocker and Betablocker unless not tolerated. Aldosterone antagonism is optional.

Study Duration: The study comprises a screening period of up to 2 years, followed by a treatment phase of a minimum of 36 months.

Randomisation: After fulfilling all eligibility criteria, subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive ICD implantation or continue usual control. Randomisation will be stratified according to treatment with a biventricular pacemaker.

Treatment: After randomisation patients allocated to ICD treatment should receive this as fast as possible and preferably within 2 weeks (latest 4 weeks). The ICD will be programmed with anti-tachycardia pacing and shock therapy.

Assessments: Deaths and hospitalisations for heart failure, stroke or arrhythmias will be recorded throughout the study duration.

Statistical Considerations: Median lifetime in the control group is expected to be 5 years. A p-value of 5% (2-sided) is required for significance together with a power of at least 80%. With a relative risk reduction of 25% a sample size of 812 patients in total is required. In order to allow for cross-over a sample size of 1000 is planned.

These factors are predictors of an unfavorable near and long-term prognosis after open cardiac surgery. It is known that the restriction of motor activity in patients with peripheral atherosclerosis and HF leads to loss of muscle mass, as well as to a decrease in its strength and endurance: secondary (disuse) sarcopenia is formed. In patients with peripheral atherosclerosis and HF, the low functional status of skeletal muscles is associated with a poor prognosis, regardless of gender, age, and concomitant coronary artery disease. A number of studies have shown that the deterioration of muscle status before abdominal, orthopedic and vascular surgery interferes with the close results of surgery, increases the number of complications, the length of ICU and in-hospital stay. Thus, sarcopenia serves as an additional factor worsening the prognosis. Therefore, efforts aimed at improving the functional status in patients planning an open cardiosurgical surgery seem to be very justified.

Standard preoperative management of patients includes the identification and correction of comorbidities and the optimal medical treatment. The idea of ""rehabilitation"" means an additional improvement in the functional capabilities of patients awaiting surgery. Prevention includes outpatient outreach and educational work by nurses, as well as preoperative physical exercises. For this, multi-level training is used: respiratory exercises for the patients with the most severe illness, free movements of the limbs without load, or bike or treadmill training with increasing load for tolerable patients.

However, adequate physical rehabilitation is difficult particularly on an outpatient basis. Low adherence is due in part to inadequate strength and inability to tolerate or sustain even low levels of activity due to angina, chronic lower limb ischemia and heart failure symptoms.

Whilst NICE recommends that CR should ""offer people an individual consultation to discuss diet"", access to registered dietitians is limited. Instead, CR patients typically receive general healthy eating guidance. Since approximately 50% of patients decline CR, online tools may improve participation. The University of Reading have developed a web-based application (eNutriCardio) that uses a diet questionnaire to assess the quality ('healthiness') of a user's diet.

NCT02939469,Skin Sympathetic Nerve Activity and Cardiac Arrhythmias,STTR Phase II : Skin Sympathetic Nerve Activity and Cardiac Arrhythmias,WITHDRAWN,2016-11-01,2018-11-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,Sympathetic Nerve Activity,Physiologic maneuvers,Chane in Sympathetic nerve activity,"Since the invention of electrocardiogram (ECG), ECG has been an important part of clinical practice. A primary reason for the popularity of the ECG is that it is non-invasive and can be performed in any patient by placing electrodes on the skin. The present methods of ECG recording focus on detecting electrical signals from the heart. the investigators propose that with high frequency sampling and high pass filtering, the investigators can also record SNA from the skin. The somata of the subcutaneous sympathetic nerves on the skin are located at the ipsilateral cervical and stellate ganglia. Because the left stellate ganglion nerve activity (SGNA) is known to trigger cardiac arrhythmias, including AF, VF and VF, It is possible that skin SNA can also be used for arrhythmia prediction. the investigators tested that hypothesis in our preclinical studies (supported by R01 HL71140) using canine models. The results showed that subcutaneous nerve activity (SCNA) recorded with implanted electrodes can be used to estimate stellate ganglion nerve activity(SGNA) in normal dogs and in a canine model of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death. the investigators also showed that SCNA is more accurate than heart rate variability in estimating cardiac sympathetic tone in ambulatory dogs with myocardial infarction.Therefore, SKNA and SCNA may be useful in estimating cardiac sympathetic tone. In addition to studying the autonomic mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmia, these new methods may have broad application in studying both cardiac and non-cardiac diseases. For example, sympathetic tone is important in the pathogenesis of heart failure, atherosclerosis, peripheral neuropathies, epilepsy, vasovagal syncope, renal failure, hypertension and many others diseases. Direct SKNA and SCNA recording may provide new approaches to study the mechanisms of these common diseases. SKNA recording may also have immediate clinical applications by assisting in the diagnosis and treatment of hyperhidrosis (sweaty palms), paralysis, stroke, diabetes, and neuromuscular diseases. It may be used to assist biofeedback monitoring performed by neurologists to control neuropsychiatric disorders. Because of these potential clinical and commercial applications, the investigators propose that this research project is significant.

b. Innovation

* Using conventional electrodes on the skin to record SNA. The neuECG utilizes the conventional skin electrodes that are widely used in health care facilities. Skin SNA had been recorded using microneurography techniques, and had been estimated using cutaneous blood flow (vasodilator responses) skin temperature, skin conductance and sweat release. However, microneurography cannot be used in ambulatory patients. The other methods are not direct measurements of SNA. neuECG is the first method that can directly and non-invasively measure the SNA from the skin.
* Automated real-time signal processing. the investigators will develop signal processing software to automatically eliminate noise, such as that generated by muscle contraction, electrical appliances, body motion, respiration, and radiofrequency signals. The remaining signals are then processed to separately display in real time to provide health care providers a new method to instantly estimate sympathetic tone. The ECG signals are used for automated arrhythmia detection while the SNA signals are available for risk stratification. This approach allows us to improve and broaden the clinical application of Einthoven's original invention by simultaneous detecting ECG and SNA from the skin.
* SKNA patterns as new biomarkers. the investigators have identified unique SKNA patterns that precede the onset of human AF. If proven correct by Specific Aim 3, this new biomarker can help physicians to estimate the arrhythmia risk and to predict the efficacy of catheter ablation for AF.",0,* Age 18-45 years of age * BMI \< 35 kg/m2,"* History of hypertension, diabetes, pulmonary disease, metabolic disease or heart failure * Cardiac rhythm disorder, specifically: rhythm other than sinus * Use of any medications other than common supplements * Unable to perform handgrip exercise * Pregnant",True,ALL,18 Years,45 Years,ADULT,United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,OTHER

The investigators will investigate if a healthy Nordic diet (HND) reduces plaque volume, coronary artery calcification (CAC), and plaque inflammation (FAI) in CHD, and examine if changes in gut microbiota may be linked to plaque progression over time. The investigators will also explore if the diet response can be predicted by the metabolic phenotype.

In total 150 CHD patients is randomized to a HND rich in unsaturated fat and fibre from plants, or to a ""usual care diet"" for 18 months. Plaque volume and composition is assessed by CT, and fecal microbiota composition is determined by deep metagenome shotgun sequencing. CHD and metabolic risk factors, liver fat, muscle fat and biomarkers of diet adherence (plasma fatty acids, whole-grain metabolites) are measured. Machine-learning is used to identify diet ""responders"" on plaque progression, based on the individual microbiome and metabolome.

If a HND reduces plaque progression, this would be novel information of clinical importance. Also, if the diet alters microbiota that are linked to plaque progression, this would be of high scientific interest.

In a lot of these patients it is neither a purely obstructive sleep-apnea syndrome nor a complete Cheyne-Stokes-respiration but a combination of both sleep related respiratory disturbances.

Previous studies showed an improvement of the central respiratory disorder, for example Cheyne-Stokes-respiration, under continuous positive pressure breathing (CPAP) and an improvement of the left ventricular pump function. (Naughton 1995, Tkacova 1997).

However, the recently published CanPAP study could not prove any improvement in the mortality among CPAP therapy patients in comparison to the optimal medical treatment, although under this therapy, the number of breathing disturbances, the oxygen saturation at night and the ejection fraction of the left ventricle showed a significant improvement.(Bradley 2005)

Earlier studies proved the adaptive servo ventilation to be an effective therapy for patients with central sleep-apnea and Cheyne-Stokes-respiration respectively. (Teschler 2001) Teschler's study showed that the adaptive servo ventilation therapy with a reduction of central sleep apnea down to 10/hours succeeded. With the SOMNOvent CR a new therapy-algorithm has been developed for the adaptive servo ventilation in patients with obstructive sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes-respiration with underlying heart disease. In the first validation study this therapy was very effective and presented only few adverse effects in the patients. (Galetke 2007)

Rehab+, a mobile cardiac rehabilitation (mCR) programme co-created with patients and rehabilitation centres, is designed to future-proof CR and to make CR more accessible to patients. Moreover, Rehab+ will be offered for 12 consecutive months after myocardial infarction and could therefore result in greater sustained effects.

The National COPD audit showed a very high level of co-morbidity, the association with cardiovascular disease being particularly strong with 51% of patients with cardiovascular disease having been admitted for COPD within the preceding 24 months. Patients with COPD are at increased risk of myocardial infarction compared to the general population. Although this increase in cardiovascular risk exists, it is not clear is whether survival after myocardial infarction is different in patients with and without COPD and what factors contribute to this survival difference. Differences in survival may arise due to differences in prescribing certain drugs such as beta-blockers, differences in prevalence of risk factors (e.g. current smoking status) or increased COPD events such as exacerbations which themselves are associated with increased mortality.

The metabolic syndrome is composed of clinical expressed symptoms as central obesity, high blood pressure, raised fasting plasma glucose or diagnosed diabetes, low HDL, and raised serum triglycerides. All those components together or independently contribute to the development of cardiovascular diseases, which are the leading cause of death in the modern world. The results from previous studies have shown that probiotic bacteria have an influence on health improvement, and can exert positive effects on diseases as diabetes, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia and low-grade inflammation, which are all components of the metabolic syndrome. The objectives of this study were to investigate which of probiotic strains Lactobacillus plantarum PCS 20, Lactobacillus plantarum PCS 26 in Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG exert positive effects in the cascade of molecular reactions at the level of small intestines, at remodeling of monocytes/macrophages and adipocytes in human cell model of non-cancerous origin, and to provide scientific explanation of mechanisms of possible multi-leveled activity of selected probiotic strains in patients with metabolic syndrome. For this purpose, the investigators divided this research into two parts. The first part consisted of pre-clinical in-vitro laboratory study. It examined the mechanisms of actions of probiotic cultures with the use of functional cell models of non-cancerous origin, more specifically, with the use of cell lines of human intestinal epithelium, human monocytes/macrophages and human visceral preadipocytes.

What is the effect of continuing aspirin until the time of coronary artery bypass graft surgery and of adding clopidogrel to aspirin after coronary artery bypass graft surgery for preventing blockage of coronary grafts, heart attack, stroke, and death? To reliably answer this question requires a large randomised trial. Before applying for a major grant from the Canadian Institute for Health Research to do the large study we would like to perform a small pilot study of 150 patients to demonstrate that it is feasible to recruit patients and to use a new test called ""CT angiography"" to determine whether the bypass grafts are still working or have become blocked.

(ii) Why is this research important? Coronary artery bypass surgery has made a very important contribution to improving the health and survival of patients with advanced coronary artery disease but still has many problems. One in 10 patients experiences a heart attack at the time of surgery, 1 in 20 experiences a heart attack, stroke, or death during hospitalization, and 1 in 4 patients has at least 1 blocked graft within 1 year of surgery. Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin and clopidogrel are effective for preventing heart attacks, strokes and deaths but aspirin is usually stopped before coronary artery bypass graft surgery because of concerns about increasing the risk of bleeding. The effectiveness of the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin after surgery has not been evaluated. Our pilot study will provide key information about feasibility that will help us to design and perform a large definitive study in the future.

(iii) What is being studied? We will be looking at blood flow in bypass grafts as well as the occurrence of heart attack, stroke, and death. For safety we will be looking at bleeding, transfusion, and need for further surgery because of bleeding. We will also perform laboratory tests of platelet function to measure and compare the effect of the study treatments to prevent blood clots from forming.",150,"* Patients 18 years of age or older * Undergoing on-pump, elective coronary artery bypass grafting with at least 2 free grafts * Patient able to give informed consent","* planned date of surgery is \<5 days from planned recruitment date * patient has clear indication for anticoagulation (eg. mechanical heart valve, atrial fibrillation) or ADP receptor antagonist (eg. drug-eluting stent) * allergy to or intolerance of aspirin or clopidogrel * history of bleeding diathesis, significant GI bleed, ICH, or liver failure * Patient has known renal failure or contraindication for Cardiac CT Angio * Patient has had previous cardiac surgery",False,ALL,18 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,Canada,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation,OTHER

For approximately 30% of patients that present with locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the standard treatment is curative-intent concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Outcomes remain poor, with 5-year survival of only 20%. Despite the long-held belief that higher radiation doses lead to improved overall survival (OS), the landmark randomized trial (RTOG 0617) showed the opposite. The investigators hypothesize that the inferior survival observed may be due to unexpected heart toxicity as secondary analysis revealed that the heart dose was a strong predictor of inferior OS. Up to now, change in heart function is typically detected histologically, requiring autopsy tissue. Therefore, a non-invasive marker of early heart damage is required. Hybrid PET-MRI has become available in Canada only recently. The ability to simultaneously perform metabolic imaging with functional and tissue imaging allows for novel assessment of heart toxicity. The primary objective is to examine the utility of hybrid PET-MRI and DCE-CT to assess acute changes in heart function and to measure inflammation before, and six weeks after NSCLC radiotherapy. A pilot of 20 patients with Stage I-III NSCLC will be enrolled. The findings of this study will aid in the design of new studies to reassess dose escalation for locally advanced NSCLC while limiting the risk of heart toxicity. FDG PET will be used to simultaneously assess both cardiac inflammation and tumour response. Quantitative DCE-CT will also be used to measure ventilation and perfusion changes in the normal lung and tumour after radiotherapy, providing image data that can comprehensively assess both tumour response and potential toxicity in both the heart and lungs. Such information is crucial in understanding the disease and its response to treatment.

However, a large proportion of these patients (approximately 180,000 annually) are referred for outpatient objective cardiac testing (exercise stress tests, myocardial perfusion scans, coronary CT angiography) after ED discharge, even though their short-term risk of major adverse cardiac events such as death, new myocardial infarction or need for revascularization is very small. This contributes to substantial low-value healthcare utilization, and limits access for those patients who are likely to benefit from objective testing.

Clinical risk prediction tools can improve the appropriateness of utilization of cardiac testing. However, existing risk prediction tools were developed prior to the advent of new high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays, were derived in non-representative populations and, when applied to ED patients with low cardiac troponin concentrations, systematically overestimate short-term risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE).

New, more specific, risk prediction tools are required to accurately guide clinical decision-making for patients who have had an emergency department evaluation for suspected coronary disease. The objective of this research program is to develop individualized risk prediction tools for patients who have had an MI ruled out in the emergency department, to identify patients who are likely to benefit from additional cardiac testing, and to guide the appropriate timing of testing. In other words, the objective is to provide personalized risk estimates to get the Right Patient the Right Test at the Right Time.

We will conduct a multicenter prospective cohort study including emergency department chest pain patients to derive personalized risk prediction tools to distinguish patients at low risk of MACE and not requiring additional cardiac testing from patients who are likely to benefit from additional cardiac testing. We will leverage the existing clinical research infrastructure of the Canadian Emergency Department Rapid Response Network to enrol a large population of representative patients.

The risk prediction tools that we will develop will innovate in the following ways:

1. We will include the right population, namely patients who have had MI ruled out in the ED, as current risk prediction tools were derived in different populations;
2. We will provide improved accounting for sex and the presence of pre-existing coronary disease compared to previous tools;
3. We will incorporate the latest generation cardiac troponin assay;
4. We will investigate the utility of other commonly available biomarkers that have excellent predictive utility in other cardiovascular diseases;
5. We will undertake time-to-event analyses to suggest the optimal timing of additional cardiac testing;

5) We will provide granular, individualized risk estimates to guide decision-making around which patients need additional testing.

The primary chronic symptom in patients with HFpEF is severe exercise intolerance quantified as reduced peak oxygen uptake during whole body exercise (peak V̇O2). To date, studies have focused almost exclusively on central cardiac limitations of peak V̇O2 in HFpEF. However, in stark contrast to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), drug therapies targeting central limitations have invariably failed to improve peak V̇O2, quality of life, or survival in HFpEF. Emerging evidence from our lab suggests reduced skeletal muscle oxidative capacity may contribute to exercise intolerance in HFpEF patients. However, the mechanisms responsible for peripheral metabolic inefficiency remain unclear. Reduced blood flow (oxygen delivery), and slowed oxygen uptake kinetics (O2 utilization) may both contribute to reduced peripheral oxidative capacity. Importantly, reduced oxidative capacity may result in increased production of metabolites known to activate muscle afferent nerves and stimulate reflex increases in muscle sympathetic (vasoconstrictor) nervous system activity (MSNA). However, to date there have been no studies specifically investigating the contribution of peripheral metabolic and neural impairments to reduced exercise capacity in HFpEF. The overall aim of this proposal will be 1) to identify impairments in peripheral vascular, metabolic, and sympathetic neural function and 2) to assess the ability of small muscle mass (knee extensor, KE) training, specifically targeting these peripheral skeletal muscle deficiencies, to improve aerobic capacity and exercise tolerance in HFpEF.

GLOBAL HYPOTHESIS 1: HFpEF patients will demonstrate reduced skeletal muscle oxygen delivery, slowed oxygen uptake kinetics, and elevated resting and metaboreflex mediated MSNA.

Hypothesis 1.1: The vasodilatory response to knee extensor exercise will be impaired in HFpEF patients.

Specific Aim 1.1: To measure the immediate rapid onset vasodilatory response to muscle contraction, as well as the dynamic onset, and steady state vasodilatory responses to dynamic KE exercise.

Hypothesis 1.2: Skeletal muscle oxygen uptake kinetics will be slowed in HFpEF.

Specific Aim 1.2: To measure pulmonary oxygen uptake kinetics during isolated KE exercise in order to isolate peripheral impairments in metabolic function independent of any central impairment.

Hypothesis 1.3: HFpEF patients will demonstrate elevated MSNA at rest, and exaggerated metaboreflex sensitivity during exercise.

Specific Aim 1.3: To test this hypothesis the investigators will measure MSNA from the peroneal nerve at rest, and during post exercise ischemia to directly assess metaboreflex sensitivity in HFpEF.

GLOBAL HYPOTHESIS 2: Isolating peripheral adaptations to exercise training using single KE exercise training will improve peripheral vascular, metabolic, and neural function and result in greater functional capacity in HFpEF.

Hypothesis 2.1: Isolated KE exercise training will improve the vasodilatory response to exercise, speed oxygen uptake kinetics, and reduce MSNA at rest HFpEF.

Specific Aim 2.1: The assessments of vascular, metabolic, and neural function proposed in hypothesis 1 will be repeated after completing 8 weeks of single KE exercise training.

Hypothesis 2.2: Single KE exercise training will improve whole body exercise tolerance, peak V̇O2, and functional capacity in HFpEF.

Specific Aim 2.2: To test this hypothesis the investigators will measure maximal single KE work rate, V̇O2 kinetics and peak V̇O2 during cycle exercise, as well as distance covered in the six minute walk test.",22,"* Patients will be \> 65 years old * We will use a modification of the European Guidelines for the diagnosis of HFpEF to select the patient population. * The key components of these guidelines include: * signs and symptoms of heart failure; * b) an ejection fraction \> 0.50; and * c) objective evidence of diastolic dysfunction.

Montelukast is proven safe and effective in alleviating pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress when used in prevention of asthma episode.

Study objectives:

1. To test the hypothesis of pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress-related vascular dysfunction in PM air pollution.
2. To evaluate the impact of Montelukast treatment as compared with placebo on predictive atherosclerosis surrogates (FMD and IMT).

Design: Parallel placebo control, randomized comparative study. Subjects will be randomized to take Montelukast (10mg/daily) or image-matched placebo for 26 weeks. Measures will include PM2.5/PM10, indices of subclinical atherosclerosis (brachial FMD and CIMT), blood inflammatory biomarkers (platelet counts, hsCRP and fibrinogen) and potential confounders (lipids and glucose).

Deaths associated with ectopic pregnancy have declined, though approximately 75% of deaths in the first trimester and 9-13% of all pregnancy-related deaths are associated ectopic pregnancy. The main stays of management for ectopic pregnancy were surgery and medical treatment. Medical management with systemic methotrexate administration avoids the inherent morbidity of anesthesia and surgery is cost-effective, and also offers success rates comparable to surgical management, with no loss in future potential fertility.

However, although medical management using methotrexate is used commonly, there is no solid consensus regarding dose protocol. Currently, there are three methotrexate protocols for the treatment of an ectopic pregnancy, ""multi-dose"", ""single-dose"", or ""two-dose"". Among them, the multi-dose protocol includes the administration of 4 methotrexate doses alternating with leucovorin (rescue regimen). As a result of the multiple dosing of methotrexate, side effects are more common. In contrast, the advantages of the single-dose protocol include elimination of a rescue regimen, lower incidence of adverse effects, and better compliance. However, the single-dose protocol was found to be associated with a considerably lower success rate as compared with the multi-dose protocol (88% versus 93%) in a recent meta-analysis. The two-dose protocol, which it balances efficacy and safety/convenience, was described as a cross between the multi-dose and single-dose protocols.

Hyperphosphatemia usually results in a high calcium-phosphorus product (CPP) which may subsequently lead to artery and become a risk factor of cardiovascular complications. Alendronate, due to its effect of inhibiting osteoclasts, is approved for treatment of osteoporosis. Previous reports found the use of bisphosphonates could suppress arterial calcification in hemodialysis dialysis patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of alendronate to suppress coronary artery and aortic calcifications, as well as to improve bone density in chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.

This study will include ESRD patients who had received maintenance PD for more than 3 months, have high CPP level (≧55), and have chest X-ray proven aortic calcification or coronary artery calcification. All participants are randomly allocated to either group 1 or group 2. Group 1 patients receive alendronate 70 mg once weekly in the first 16 weeks, while group 2 patients receive the same dose of drug every week in the second 16 weeks.

Both examinations are performed at week 0, 16 and 32 for each participant. Laboratory studies and possible adverse reactions were regularly monitored.

We expect that alendronate can alleviate the progression of arterial calcification or even improve it. Bone density may also be improved after treatment.

Recent genome-wide association studies have identified a considerable number of common genetic variants each associated with the disease. This has led to a new understanding but also to the discovery of new therapeutical targets. However, each of the variants discovered only have minor effects on disease development and even the pooling of the variants only explains a minor percentage of the total heritability. It has been evident that rare or private mutations probably play a great role in the genetic architecture of CAD, especially among young and severely affected patients. These may only be identified by sequencing. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize, that the use of exome sequencing (the read-off of the entire protein-coding regions of the genome) and linkage analysis in families of extreme phenotype cases, will identify disease-causing genetic variants. From the West Denmark Heart Registry the investigators will enroll a minimum of 120 patients with atherosclerosis who have undergone a coronary artery revascularization procedure before the age of 40, to participate in study part 1.

Heart failure clinicians are faced daily with the need to set up short- and long- term therapeutic strategies in line with heart failure etiology and myocardial recovery chances of each patient. Current treatment strategies for severe heart failure also include mechanical circulatory support with artificial devices (such as intraaortic balloon pump, Impella, ECMO, durable left ventricular assist device), which poses specific challenges for cardiac imaging. Through its ability to directly visualize scar and evaluate its transmural extent, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) offers a unique advantage over other currently available imaging techniques as a central player in viability assessment in patients with coronary disease, and represents the first line technique to investigate the chances of myocardial function recovery. CMR is also an important tool to provide diagnostic data in patients with non-ischemic heart failure. Unfortunately, CMR is not feasible in many heart failure patients (for example those on MCS therapy) due to the metallic components of the mechanical devices. In these patients, the computed tomography (CT) is the alternative imaging technique to visualize cardiac structures, diagnose complications, and assess possible indications for surgical interventions. However, CT has poorer resolution and do not offer the possibility to evaluate myocardial viability in patients with contraindication to CMR. Therefore, this issue currently represents one of the major unmet needs in the clinical management of severe heart failure patients.

Recent technological advances in the field of CT imaging have nevertheless paved the way to explore new pathways of myocardial viability assessment even in patients traditionally deemed unsuitable for CMR. The introduction of photon-counting detectors, in particular, is expected to be the next major breakthrough in clinical x-ray computed tomography (CT). Photon-counting detector (PCD)-CT will overcome several shortcomings and limitations of current CT systems: it might substantially improve and expand the applicability of CT imaging by offering intrinsic spectral capabilities, increased spatial resolution, reduced electronic noise and improved image contrast. On the basis of this physical principle PCCT has the promise to improve the actual not fully satisfactory quality of scar visualization in CT images. In particular, conventional scanners are affected by a limited contrast resolution which lead to a variable and relevant rate of false negative myocardial scar-free images depending on the assessor expertise. The constant improving of CT diagnostic field have been revolutionizing the diagnostic workflow in several cardiac disease. Late contrast enhancement CT demonstrated an adequate accuracy to detect and discriminate the etiology of both ischemic and non-ischemic causes of myocardial injury compared to actual gold standard exams in patients with a troponin-positive acute chest pain syndrome. The same technique showed good sensitivity, specificity and a high negative predictive value (95%) for the identification of myocardial scars imputed to be an anatomical substrate of ventricular tachycardia with a proper concordance with electro-anatomic mapping findings (k=0.536). Finally, this enormous potential of CT implementation with the novel PCCT will provide not only the possibility to further study myocardial viability, but also is expected to be superior to standard CT exams in details definition, reduction of electronic noise and increase of spatial resolution, with consequent specific advantages in patients with heart failure, especially those with artificial devices with metallic components, in which adverse event identification and definition (such as inflow or outflow thrombosis) is complex. Thanks to these multiple diagnostic and therapeutic advantages, in combination with the availability of the PCCT device, the use of such technique is now the preferred cardiac imaging examination for the study of cardiac anatomy and function in patients with severe heart failure and a contraindication to perform the gold standard CMR. Thus, we planned a single-center observational study to asses the performance of PCCT in the identification of myocardial scars and patterns in critically ill patients with severe heart failure.",150,* Presence of acute or chronic heart failure * Clinical need for a CT exam with angiographic evaluation and scar imaging * Contraindication to perform a Magnetic Resonance Imaging. * All ages * Signature of Informed Consent,* Absence of acute or chronic heart failure * Absence of clinical indication to a CT exam * Contraindication to perform a CT exam. * Pregnancy * Refusal to provide Informed Consent to participate to the study,False,ALL,N/A,N/A,CHILD; ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,N/A,"Anna Mara Scandroglio, MD",CONTACT,+39 0226437722,scandroglio.mara@hsr.it,Università Vita-Salute San Raffaele,N/A

OSA has been identified as the most common secondary cause associated with resistant hypertension. There is evidence that compared with older patients, the risk of hypertension in OSA patients may be particularly pronounced in younger adult ones (less than 50 years).

Traditionally, cardiovascular risk stratification in hypertensive patients was based on the average blood pressure (BP) measured in the clinic. Accumulated data has shown that target-organ damage is related not only to 24-h mean intra-arterial BP, but also to BP variability (BPV) in subjects with essential hypertension. Growing evidence demonstrated that BPV has considerable prognostic value for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes, independent of average BP. In addition, it has been found that hypoxia condition in pneumoconiosis patients was closely associated with exaggerated BPV in ambulatory BP.

Cardiovascular congestion with resultant limitation in physical activity is the hallmark of chronic and decompensated HF. The current HF physiologic model suggests that congestion is the result of volume retention and, therefore, therapies (such as diuretics) have generally been targeted at volume overload. Yet therapeutic approaches to reduce congestion have failed to show significant benefit on clinical outcomes, potentially due to an untargeted approach of decongestive therapies. The investigators' preliminary work suggested a complimentary contribution of volume redistribution to the mechanism of cardiac decompensation. The investigators identified the splanchnic nerves as a potential therapeutic target and showed that short-term interruption of the splanchnic nerve signaling could have favorable effects on cardiovascular hemodynamics and symptoms.

As part of the investigators' proposal, the investigators will test the safety and efficacy of prolonged splanchnic nerve block in a randomized, controlled, blinded study in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

However, while LVAD supports the left side of the heart, the right side must work on its own. Sometimes the right side does not recover, a condition called right ventricular failure (RVF). This complication increases mortality, prolongs hospitalization, requires additional procedures, and increases costs. Several risk factors and scores have been proposed to identify patients at risk for RVF. However, these methods have proven inadequate; one out of three patients is still experiencing right ventricular failure after LVAD surgery.

Echocardiography, an established noninvasive method to see the heart without radiation or risk, has a lot of potential to identify patients at risk for RVF. The questions we will tray to answer with this American Heart Association funded project are:

1. Can echocardiography before scheduled LVAD surgery predict who is going to develop RVF and poor quality of life so we can better select patients for LVAD surgery?
2. Can echocardiography before scheduled LVAD surgery tell us the course of right ventricular function after implantation so we can potentially take additional measures and prevent RVF?

To answer these questions, we will record images of the heart with echocardiography before LVAD surgery in 120 LVAD recipients at Emory University. We will then follow the patients for 90 days to detect any symptoms and signs of clinical RVF and poor quality of life and record the course of right ventricular function with echocardiography.

Currently, it is estimated that 150,000 to 250,000 patients in US are potential LVAD recipients with 2,000 devices implanted in 2012. LVAD can improve survival and quality of life in suitable patients. However, implantation requires a major surgical procedure with associated risks and considerable resources. Thus, careful patient selection is necessary to minimize risk for patients and maximize benefit for patients and society. Our long-term goal is to use echocardiography as a tool to (1) optimally select patients for LVAD and offer alternatives to patients at increased risk for complications and (2) potentially, inform earlier LVAD implantation in patients with weakening right ventricular function.",83,* Age 18-75 years * Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) Class 2-7 * Willing to participate * Able to give consent,"* INTERMACS Class 1 * Pre-operative advanced RVF, defined as planned or anticipated need for RVAD or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation at surgery * Unresponsive pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) \>6 Wood units",False,ALL,18 Years,75 Years,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Emory University,OTHER

Acute rejection, a process where the immune system recognizes the transplanted heart as foreign and mounts a response against it, remains a clinical problem despite improvements in immunosuppressive drugs. Acute rejection occurs in 20-30% of patients within the first 3 months post-transplant, and is currently detected by highly invasive heart tissue biopsies that happen 12-15 times in the first year post-transplant. Replacing the biopsy with a simple blood test is of utmost value to patients and will reduce healthcare costs.

Our sophisticated analytic methods has recently derived HEARTBiT, a promising test of acute rejection comprising 9 RNA biomarkers, from the measurement of 30,000 blood molecules in 150 Canadian heart transplant patients. Our objective is to study a custom-built HEARTBiT test in a setting and on a technology that enable clinical adoption. We will evaluate the new test on 400 new patients from 5 North American transplant centres. We will also track patients' HEARTBiT scores over time to help predict future rejection, and explore use of proteins and micoRNAs to improve HEARTBiT. Our work will provide the basis for a future clinical trial. The significance of this work rests in that it will provide a tool to identify acute cardiac rejection in a fast, accurate, cost-effective and minimally invasive manner, allowing for facile long-term monitoring and therapy tailoring for heart transplant patients.",196,* recipients who are ≥ 19 years of age * willing and able to provide informed consent * all individuals who are ≥ 19 years of age * willing and able to provide informed consent,"* recipients under 19 years of age * recipients who have received multiple, different solid organ transplants (i.e. a heart and a kidney) * recipients who are HIV positive * recipients of organs from donors who test positive for HIV",True,ALL,19 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,Canada; United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,University of British Columbia,OTHER

The main cause is ischemic heart disease but there are several causes of non-ischemic nature including sepsis.

Sepsis is characterized by a picture of organ dysfunction caused by an altered response of the body to an infection. Its most serious form is septic shock, defined as a picture of sepsis in which the underlying abnormalities in the cardiovascular system and cellular metabolism are such as to increase mortality. An organ failure correlates directly with the function of others and this interdependence is especially evident when a cardiovascular failure is established. 3 Cardiac dysfunction in sepsis can be defined as that of a syndrome characterized by low cardiac output not related to myocardial ischemia.

The use of levosimendan in cardiogenic shock during sepsis was first described in a 2005 case report. Since then there have been small studies and other case reports that have shown improvements in right and left ventricular contractility, ventricular coupling, cardiopulmonary performance, global oxygen transport, renal and splanchnic perfusion when compared to dobutamine and placebo. Other beneficial effects of this drug have emerged, including an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiapoptotic action with a possible protection from ischemia-reperfusion damage.

The main objective in these trials was to study the clinical effects of homocysteine-lowering therapy with folic acid and vitamin B12 in patients with established coronary artery disease. Follow-up was terminated for NORVIT on Marc 31st 2004 and for WENBIT October 5th 2005, and none of the two trials proved any protective effect of the B-vitamin intervention on cardiovascular outcomes.

There is so far no data on possible long-term effects following years of such B-vitamin treatment.

Thus, the main objective of the combinded NORVIT-WENBIT study will will be to evaluate the long-term effect of the B-vitamin intervention on incident life-style diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporotic fractures and cancer.

Therefore, the risk of having AF increases up to 4,5 -5,9 times with the presence of HF. Both conditions share risk factors and the presence of the one worsens the progress of the other. Therefore, the AF is not only relevant in terms of thromboembolic events. Timing of AF progression seems to be associated with an increase in all causes of mortality. Although, it is estimated that between 30%-40% of the patients with HF develop AF, given that in many cases it occurs with no apparent symptoms for the patients, is considered that the number of affected patients is greater. Since silent AF poses a problem of great impact in patients with HF, monitoring through continuous electrocardiographic registry could be useful in those patients with a higher risk of thromboembolic events. The purpose of this study is to understand the mechanism and biological and clinical relevance of the AF from a holistic approach. Trying to distinguish the symptomatic AF from the silent one using the implementation of insertable cardiac devices. The purpose of this study is 1. To determine in which percentage of patients with HF, episodes of AF both symptomatic and asymptomatic occur, as well as if the presence of AF represents an irrelevant fact in the progression of the insufficiency or in the contrary, it is the cause of the HF patients clinical decline. 2. To examine the presence of triggers of AF in patients with HF and to identify the presence of clinical markers, image markers of the atrium and left ventricle, as well as biomarkers which allow the risk of stratification and could mean future therapeutic targets.",300,* Patients with the previous diagnosis of HF with both preserved and depressed LVEF.
