Novel POC hs-cTn testing technology can provide results in minutes, potentially reducing the ED length of stay. This may lead to a reduction in ED crowding, which is a growing worldwide healthcare problem, resulting in poorer patient outcomes.

The analysis of the composition of the clot constitutes a promising tool for investigating the possible pathogenetic mechanisms underlying ischemic stroke. This analysis was made possible thanks to the numerous mechanical thrombectomy operations which have now become routine.

Several studies have attempted to explore the possible relationship between the primary site of thrombus formation and clot composition, reporting that cardioembolic stroke may have a higher percentage of platelet-rich areas than noncardioembolic thrombosis. However, the data are conflicting and do not seem to support an association between clot histology and etiology. Furthermore, thrombus composition appears to influence thrombolysis and the efficacy of thrombectomy. For example, fibrin-rich thrombi appear to reduce the effectiveness of thrombolytic treatment and require more steps with mechanical thrombectomy treatment.

Primary ENDPOINT:

Evaluate how clot composition relates to stroke etiology according to the TOAST classification.

Secondary ENDPOINT:

* relationship between different clot components and the degree of thrombectomy recanalization as defined by treatment modified cerebral ischemia score (mTICI).
* relationship between the different components of the clot and the number of steps required to achieve recanalization.
* relationship between the different clot components and outcome indicators (NIHSS score and mRS score).

TARGET POPULATION Patients with ischemic stroke with occlusion of large intracranial vessels will be included in the study if deemed suitable for mechanical thrombectomy therapy in accordance with national and international guidelines.

INCLUSION CRITERIA

* age \> 18 years;
* Patients diagnosed with large vessel occlusion stroke in the emergency room CT Angio-study, undergoing mechanical thrombectomy procedure.
* Recovered thrombus available for analysis

EXCLUSION CRITERIA

● Lack of written informed consent.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The clot will be portioned. Part of the sample will be fixed in a 10% formalin solution (3.7% formaldehyde), part will be frozen in liquid nitrogen. Within 24-48 hours of fixation, formalin-fixed thrombi will be dehydrated by increasing the concentration of ethanol (70%, -80%, -95%, 100%) and paraffin-embedded allowing good preservation of tissue morphology and easy long-term storage. The included samples will be sectioned along the major axis of the thrombus, in slices with a thickness between 4 and 5 µm.

Base staining will be used to visualize RBC, PLT and fibrin.

* Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) will allow visualization of general thrombus structures and identification of aggregates of fibrin/platelets (colored pink), red blood cells (red), and nucleated cells (dark blue).

Patients with GAD may occur a series of somatic symptoms including muscle tension, backaches, headaches, fatigue, insomnia, restlessness, as well as psychological feelings of anxiety, worry and feeling overwhelmed. And it always brings some type of functional disability or decrease in quality of life. GAD is treated by Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) or Serotonin, Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors(SNRI) and 5-ht1a receptor agonists as regular medication which have the definite effects. But, some adverse reaction of SSRIs or SNRI leads to the compliance of taking medicine of patients with GAD. There is an impressive data suggesting that Abdominal Massage Therapy is effective in decreasing some symptoms of somatic symptoms and psychological feelings.

* Whether quantification of left ventricular (LV) scar volume by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMRI) prior to hospital discharge helps to predict which patients will have a low ejection fraction (35%) at follow up and qualify for ICD implantation.
* Whether quantification of infarct scar volume by CMRI will help to identify which patients will experience malignant ventricular arrhythmias and/or SCD at follow-up, independent of the LV ejection fraction (LVEF).

Primary hypothesis:

Percentage of left ventricular scar volume as measured by CMRI post-MI strongly correlates with LVEF at 40 days and 3 months.

Secondary hypothesis:

1. A volume of \>40% of left ventricular scar measured by CMRI post-MI is predictive of LVEF less than 35% at 40 days and at 3 months
2. Volume scar as measured by Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging after AMI (at day 5) is predictive of clinical outcomes: SCD, total mortality, heart failure admission and life-threatening malignant ventricular arrhythmias regardless of ejection fraction at 40 days and at 3 months.

Safety hypothesis:

In France, the prevalence of this pathology is 2.3% (it reaches 10% in the over 75 years) and affects nearly a million patients.

The rehospitalization of patients with heart failure affects 25% of patients within 1-3 months of hospital discharge, and 66% at 1 year while 75% of hospitalizations are preventable. These readmissions result in decreased quality of life and increased mortality; from an economic point of view, hospitalization accounts for 70% of expenses related to the management of heart failure. Avoiding rehospitalization is therefore a major public health issue. The current predictive scores remain perfectible, even though risk factors for readmission have already been the subject of numerous studies. The identification of patients at risk of rehospitalization is still an issue, especially for patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.

Background: The TIME-1 investigators documented a 27% (109 to 80 minutes) reduction of time from EMT arrival at the scene to successful primary PCI implementing pre-hospital ECG transmission to the ED. ECG transmission directly to a physician's cellular phone/PDA through a wireless modem has only recently become an option. The recently completed TIME-NorthEast (NE) study tested the Welch Allyn version of this system and the results show a reduction in time to reperfusion for acute MI patients by 66 minutes (116 to 50).

Methods: This study will involve approximately 20 sites around the country. The study will be divided into two phases: a consecutive control data collection phase (Phase I) and an intervention with concurrent control phase (Phase II). Phase II will begin after installation of Welch Allyn ECG transmission equipment. The primary end-point will be time to reperfusion and secondary end-points will include myocardial salvage, aborted infarction and hospital mortality. ECG measurements will be made at a central ECG core lab by a blinded investigator.

Data Analysis: Patient characteristics for the three periods were compared with the chi-square statistic for categorical variables and one-way analysis of variance for age.

Histologically, TTS can be accompanied by severe morphological alterations potentially resulting from catecholamine excess followed by microcirculatory dysfunction and direct cardiotoxicity. The affected myocardium, however, has a high potential of structural reconstitution which correlates with the rapid functional recovery. The lack of persistent morphological changes in TTS has been confirmed by original CMR studies which pointed out that the acute phase of the disease is characterized only by remarkable myocardial edema with no evidence of significant late gadolinium enhancement. Indeed, the absence of LGE in TTS patients has become a common diagnostic criterion in most CMR centers. Although some studies have challenged this notion by reporting delayed hyper-enhancement in TTS patients, the intensity and extent of LGE in the acute phase of TTS are less than usually reported in studies of myocardial infarction.

The long-term clinical and functional consequences of an acute episode of TTS are still unclear. A recent spectroscopic investigation has shown that long-term (\>1 year) abnormalities in cardiac energetic persist after an acute episode of TTS. Also, a few patients with residual wall motion abnormality in whom LGE fails to resolve (suggesting the acute event resulted in frank infarction) have been reported. However, how often persistent morphologic abnormalities are present after the index episode remains undefined. The possibility exists that fibrosis was undetected at follow-up CMR studies using conventional LGE threshold methods due to the fact that myocardial injury is subtler and there are no confidently recognizable reference regions of normal myocardium.

The effect of supplementing oxygen in a single effort was found to improve the level of oxygen reaching the muscle, the duration and intensity of the effort.

The effect of supplemental oxygen during an exercise program in heart failure patients on exercise performance has not yet been examined.

The aims of the study: 1. To test the effect of a training program with oxygen supplementation, on maximal and submaximal aerobic exercise, six-minute walk (6MWT) and quality of life in patients with heart failure. 2. Testing the effect of oxygen supplementation in a single effort on the lactate concentration and performance of the effort.

Methods: 24 independent heart failure patients, without a decrease in saturation, with an ejection fraction \<50% were recruited for the study and were randomly divided into two groups, a training group with supplemental oxygen (O2) and a control group that trained without supplemental oxygen. Before and after a training program that lasted two months, the following were tested: maximal aerobic power, submaximal aerobic exercise time, 6MWT, disease severity according to the New York Heart Association - NYHA and quality of life according to the Kansas Questionnaire (KCCQ)). In addition, a single submaximal effort was performed at 80% of maximum heart rate with and without oxygen supplementation. Every 3 minutes the lactate concentration, heart rate and the difficulty of the effort were measured.

Troponin is released to the bloodstream as a result of an cardiomyocyte injury. Troponin is frequently assessed in hospital care for patients with chest pain and dyspnea.

Guidelines recommend troponin assessment at admission and repeated at 3 to 6 hours, depending on the assay. High-sensitivity assays measure concentrations that are ten-times lower than earlier generations of assays. However, the time from when troponin is elevated in the bloodstream after an ischemic injury, measured with high-sensitivity assays, are not fully known.

During an X-ray imaging of the heart's blood vessels (coronary angiogram) it is possible to do a short, controlled occlusion of coronary artery by inflating a small balloon in one of the coronary arteries. Numerous earlier studies in patients have used this method for induced occlusion of one coronary artery for 1 to 3 minutes. Only one of the studies measured troponin I.

The aim with this study is to quantify and compare the release of troponin T and troponin I in the early hours after a controlled induced ischemia.

Study Design This is a prospective, descriptive and experimental study. There will be included 40 patients, without acute ischemic cardiac disease. They will be randomized in 4 groups.

0: 10 patients - control group, no balloon occlusion

1. 10 patients - balloon occlusion for 30 seconds
2. 10 patients - balloon occlusion for 60 seconds
3. 10 patients - balloon occlusion for 90 seconds

Subsequently there will be assessed serial blood samples 0 - 3 hours: Every 15 minutes 3 - 6 hours: Every 30 minutes

Statistics This is a pilot study and it is estimated that ten patients are sufficient number of patients in each group to assess elevation of troponin after occlusion of coronary artery. The thesis is there is a dosage-response correlation between the length of balloon occlusion and the concentration of troponin in blood stream.",34,* \> 18 years of age Elective coronary angiogram Informed signed accept,* Stenosis or atherosclerosis of the coronary artery Renal Failure or p-creatinin \> 100 µmol/L Heart Failure or LVEF \< 50 Severe Heart Valve Disease,False,ALL,18 Years,85 Years,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,Denmark

This is one of the major concerns to extend TAVI to low surgical risk, although the favorable results from PARTNER 3.

The presence of moderate to severe PVL after TAVI is associated to a 2- and 3- fold increase in the mortality rate at 30-day and 1-year follow-up, respectively (24-29).

* 1-month and 1-year mortality rates for stroke and MIs have decreased by 17% in 5 years, increasing the number of survivors but with chronic disabilities;
* the aging of the population and the arrival of the baby boomers of the 1950s in the at-risk age groups has increased the at-risk population;
* Stroke and MI recurrence rates reached a threshold of 6% / year, in contrast to the very high rates of re-hospitalization at 1 year: 30% post-stroke and 20% post-MI, due to poorly anticipated and controlled complications. These reasons explain the lack of significant progress in preventing recurrences, preventable complications (heart failure and arrhythmias after MI; falls, sphincter and swallowing disorders, dementia and arrhythmias after stroke) and re-admission. This observation is aggravated by problems of medical demography and therefore the availability of neurologists, cardiologists and general practitioners.

Local and foreign experiments have demonstrated the value of intensive, coordinated and multi-professional stroke and MI monitoring, including nurses, in terms of: better control of risk factors and reduction of the rate of re-hospitalization by recurrence in stroke follow-up; improvement of the patient's general condition, control of risk factors, reduction in the number of events, decrease in the number of re-hospitalizations and their duration in MI follow-up. The value of pharmacists' additional intervention in intensive post-MI follow-up compared to routine follow-up has also been demonstrated, particularly in terms of significant improvement in patient compliance.

The hypothesis is that 2 years of intensive follow-up for both post-stroke or post-MI patients, by trained hospital and liberal nurses, in conjunction with doctors and pharmacists, is of medico-economic interest compared to usual follow-up. Therefore a medico-economic evaluation was designed to evaluate the efficiency of this model, which combines community-based and recourse care, prevention and coordination of care compared to usual follow-up.",1720,"* Patient or legal representative who has given oral consent * Patient over 18 years of age * Patient with:   * either a primary MI or a recurrent MI, not previously included, defined according to the criteria of the European Society of Cardiology and ICD-10   * either a primary stroke, a recurrent stroke not previously included, hemorrhagic, ischemic or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), defined according to WHO criteria, the TOAST score and the ICD-10, with a Rankin score \< 5. * Patient followed up in one of the 6 public health establishments of the GHT 21-52 (regional group of hospitals) or at the Valmy clinic in Dijon also participating in the project * Patient with estimated survival beyond 12 months","* A patient who is not affiliated to the national health insurance system; * A patient subject to legal protection (curatorship, guardianship) * To be a patient subject to a measure of judicial safeguard; * Pregnant, parturient or breastfeeding woman; * Admitted for a condition other than stroke, TIA and MI; * Experiencing heart failure before the MI; * Be managed in EHPAD before and/or after stroke or IDM.",False,ALL,18 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,France

Primary aim of these studies is to develop, test and disseminate methodological standards for the design, conduct and analysis of Pharmacoepidemiological (PE) studies applicable to different safety issues and using different data sources. To achieve this, results from PE studies on five key adverse events (AEs) performed in different databases will be evaluated. Therefore, emphasis will be on the methodological aspects of the studies in this protocol and not on the clinical consequences of the association under investigation .

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are the most common chronic airway diseases in the western world. For both, a stepwise treatment to reduce symptoms, improve lung function, and prevent risk of exacerbation is recommended using several drug classes according to guidelines published by e.g. the Global Initiative for Asthma \[GINA guideline\] and the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease \[GOLD guideline\], respectively. Beta-2-adrenoceptor agonists (B2A) are therapeutic mainstays in treating asthma and COPD due to their bronchodilative effects mediated by B2A. This drug class consists of two types of drugs: short acting B2A (SABA) which are used as a reliever medication and long acting B2A (LABA) which are used as maintenance / controller medication. Formoterol and salmeterol are the most frequently used LABA compounds with a half-life between 5-15 hrs and therefore, these compounds most commonly have labelled indications for use twice a day. .

Focussing on cardiac side effects of B2A one must consider that drugs with an opposite mechanism of action (beta-adrenoceptor-antagonists) have well-known cardio protective effects and are widely used in patients suffering from e.g. ischemic heart disease, hypertension and acute myocardial infarction (AMI)). Conversely, stimulation of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors as done by B2A may have deleterious cardiovascular effects particularly in patients with cardiac risk factors. And in fact, tachycardia and arrhythmias are well-known side effects of B2A confirming a cardiac influence of these drugs particularly after oral therapy (due to a high systemic exposure) as stated in the respective summary of product characteristics (SPCs), e.g. clenbuterol (Spiropent(R)). Obviously, inhaled drugs cause much smaller systemic exposure but cardiac side effects (e.g. arrhythmias, tachycardia) are also described in the respective SPCs (e.g. formoterol \[Foradil(R)). Furthermore, cardiac side were also reported after exposure with inhaled MA (e.g. ipratropium \[Atrovent(R)\].

Several observational studies have been performed on the association between the usage of inhaled B2A and the occurrence of AMI. However, these studies have produced conflicting results. Reasons for this variation are numerous, e.g. small number of events (AMI) leading to poor precision of risk estimate, potential misclassification of potential cardiac events versus airway-related events due to similar clinical complaints, differences in populations of drug users, measurement of drug exposure, and background risk of AMI. Additionally, a consensus document was released in 2000, redefining AMI.

To make comparing results possible, this protocol gives guidelines for conducting studies in the same way in five databases and across 3 designs (cohort, nested case-control, case-cross-over) on the association between inhaled LABA use and AMI. The main focus is to evaluate the impact of study design, population and database characteristics on the association between inhaled LABA and AMI.

Data will be collected from the following databases: The Health Improvement Network (THIN), the General Practice Research Database (GPRD), the Dutch Mondriaan project, Base de Datos para la Investigación Farmacoepidemiológica en Atencion Primaria (BIFAP), the National Databases of Denmark, and the Bavarian statutory health insurance physicians' association database.",1,"For the descriptive sudy: * patients who have at least one documented and valid data record in the period from Jan 1, 2002 to Dec 31, 2009 * patients who have a diagnosis of asthma and/or COPD For the cohort and nested case-control studies: * patients who have at least one documented and valid data record in the period from Jan 1, 2002 to Dec 31, 2009 * patients who have a diagnosis of asthma and/or COPD * patients who have at least one prescription of LABA/LAMA/SABA/SAMA",For the cohort and nested case-control studies: * patients who had AMI within 1 year before the index date,False,ALL,N/A,N/A,CHILD; ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,N/A

As early as the 1950s, right ventricular pacing (RVP) began to be used in patients with atrioventricular block or sick sinus syndrome, but in fact such pacing could cause ventricular asynchrony, which could lead to long-term myocardial perfusion injury, valvular regurgitation, heart failure, and increased risk of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. The latest guideline recommended reducing the proportion of right ventricular pacing. Additionally, in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF ≤ 35%) and complete left bundle branch block, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with biventricular pacing (BVP) has been recommended to improve cardiac function, but only about 30% of patients benefit from it, which may be related to poor left ventricular pacing site and myocardial scarring. In theory, His bundle pacing (HBP) compared with RVP can reduce the risk of functional tricuspid regurgitation when the lead position lies on the atrial side of the tricuspid valve, which may improve the right heart function and pulmonary artery pressure. In 2021, Domenico Grieco et al. explored the effect of HBP on right heart function. After 6 months of follow-up, it was found that HBP improved right heart function and pulmonary artery pressure compared with RVP.

At present, there are few discussions on the effect of physiological pacing on right ventricular hemodynamics, and the sample size is small. Internationally, the discussion of the assessment of hemodynamics is limited to non-invasive evaluation (such as echocardiography, ECG, SPECT) The gold standard for right heart hemodynamics evaluation is the measurement of invasive right heart catheterization, and there has been no relevant research so far, so the investigators further designed a study of the effect of physiological pacing on hemodynamics.",100,* age over 18 * persistent atrial fibrillation patients with uncontrolled heart rate requiring atrioventricular node ablation * patients with sick sinus syndrome or atrioventricular block eligible for pacemaker implantation * patients who can understand and sign informed consent,"* age below 18 or over 99 * concomitant diseases that may affect right heart function, including COPD, pulmonary infection, history of pulmonary embolism or right myocardial infarction, myocarditis, systemic disease * patients with temporary pacemaker implanted * right heart catheterization contraindications, including acute infection and embolic events",False,ALL,18 Years,99 Years,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,China

Triage of chest pain prior to hospital admission presents significant challenges due to the absence of sufficiently sensitive diagnostic tools. Clinical signs, symptoms, risk assessment scores, or a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) can reliably exclude acute myocardial infarction (MI). This diagnostic uncertainty has resulted in chest pain being the second most common cause for acute hospital referrals from Norwegian emergency primary care, even though chest pain is frequently non-cardiac in origin.

In acute MI events, cardiac troponins are released into the bloodstream from the damaged myocardium, where low values are used to exclude MI. Until recently, such testing has necessitated using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays, which have been limited to hospital laboratories. However, recent technological advancements in point-of-care (POC) testing allow access to whole-blood assays that meet high-sensitivity criteria.

In this upcoming project, the investigators will evaluate the implementation of a whole-blood POC assay (QuidelOrtho TriageTrue hs-cTnI) across six Norwegian emergency primary care clinics. The study plans to enrol 2,500 patients over a period of 1.5 years. The clinical performance of the novel strategy will be investigated, as well as its impact on healthcare utilization and hospital referrals compared to standard care. Additionally, the investigators will assess the prevalence of persistent chest pain and its effects on quality of life, alongside psychological stress and anxiety, through validated questionnaires.

Aspirin has been traditionally used in heart failure because a tendency towards blood clots (including stroke and heart attack, clots in the legs and in the lungs) has been observed in this group and aspirin's mechanism of action is to prevent blood clots. This is important because two-thirds of cases of heart failure are caused by a blood clot in the coronary artery resulting in a heart attack, and aspirin is given to reduce the chances of further heart attacks.

However aspirin was introduced before clinical trials as the investigators know them now were run. Systematic review of the trials of aspirin in heart failure has shown that its use does not increase survival, and there is no evidence to recommend its routine use. Another important finding was that use of aspirin may reduce the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors which do have a mortality benefit, and that aspirin was associated with an increase in hospitalisation for heart failure compared to other drugs which prevent clots or placebo.

The investigators propose that the use of aspirin in heart failure that is not caused by heart attacks (""non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy"") is unnecessary and could be stopped. The importance of finding evidence to cease unproven medications in heart failure cannot be understated. Patients with heart failure take an average of six prescription medications each day. Each medication has side effects and the interactions of all the drugs together are unknown. Aspirin itself is a drug which frequently has side effects of increased risk of bleeding, gastrointestinal ulceration, as well as kidney impairment.

NCT04915157,Efficacy of Spinal Cord Stimulation in Patients With Refractory Angina Pectoris,Efficacy of Spinal Cord Stimulation in Patients With Refractory Angina Pectoris; a Randomized Controlled Trial,RECRUITING,2021-12-21,2025-06,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,Refractory Angina Pectoris; Spinal Cord Stimulation,Spinal Cord Stimulator,Myocardial ischaemia,"There are a growing number of patients with refractory angina pectoris (RAP). RAP is defined as a 'chronic condition (\> three months) characterized by diffuse coronary artery disease in the presence of proven ischemia, which is not amendable to a combination of medical therapy, angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery'. These patients are severely restricted in performing daily activities due to debilitating angina complaints, leading to a decreased quality of life.

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a last resort treatment option for patients with RAP. SCS is a device with a lead located in the thoracic epidural space and an Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG) in the abdomen or buttock that provides neurostimulation. Four possible mechanisms explaining the beneficial effects of SCS on RAP have been described: reduction of pain perception, decreased sympathetic tone, reduced myocardial oxygen demand, and improved coronary microcirculatory blood flow.

Research into the effect of SCS on RAP up to date have mainly been observational studies, with only four placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials. All studies confirm that treatment with SCS leads to a reduction in the number of angina pectoris attacks. What is currently not clear, is whether there is a placebo effect as results vary between the studies. One study looked at the effect of SCS in patients with RAP on the reduction of ischemia (using MIBI-SPECT) with no control arm. After 12 months myocardial ischemia was reduced, but not after three months of treatment. Leading to the conclusion that the reduction is myocardial ischemia was not a direct effect of SCS, but rather due to better coronary collateralization.

The 2020 ESC guideline 'chronic coronary syndromes' mentions non-existing to promising levels of evidence with regard to treatment options in patients with RAP and concludes that SCS may be considered (Class IIB; level of evidence B). It concludes that 'larger RCTs are required to define the role of each treatment modality for specific subgroups, to decrease non-responder rates and ascertain benefit beyond potential placebo effects'.

The aim of the current randomized controlled trial (double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled, single center) is to determine if high density spinal cord stimulation, a paresthesia free form of stimulation, leads to a significant reduction in myocardial ischemia (using PET with Rubidium-82 as tracer) in patients with refractory angina pectoris.

All patients included in this study will receive an implanted spinal cord stimulator after a positive TENS treadmill outcome and proven ischemia using the imaging modality PET with Rubidium-82 as tracer. Using a cross-over design all patients will have a 6 month period with high density stimulation and 6 month period of no stimulation. Randomization will determine in which order the patient receives these treatments. Both the patient and the treating physicians are blinded for this randomization process. At baseline a 6-minute walking test, the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, the RAND-36 questionnaire, the NRS scale and the CCS class will be performed/filled out.

Cross-over takes place at 6 months (switch from high density stimulation to no stimulation or vice versa) prior to which the PET scan is repeated, as well as the 6-minute walking test, the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, the RAND-36 questionnaire, the NRS-scale and the CCS-class.

However, its post-mortem diagnosis is particularly difficult because the gross examination of the heart is usually normal at the autopsy . The diagnosis is therefore often based on a set of indirect arguments, such as the patient's medical and clinical history and the degree of occlusion of the coronary arteries. The formal diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) currently relies on standard histological examination. However, histological findings often require a prolonged survival time of several hours to be highlighted. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) is a salt that reacts with lactate dehydrogenases contained in still viable myocardial cells, forming a red pigment visible to the naked eye, (1,3,5 triphenylformazan). Ischemia-induced cell death, which occurs within minutes of the causative event, is responsible for the leakage of lactate deshydrogenase into the extracellular medium and thus results in the absence of formazan formation in the infarcted area, which displays an easily identifiable pale unstained color. It has been suggested that the use of TTC would allow the identification of MI as early as one hour of survival in animal models, before the usual macroscopic and microscopic signs are visible.

This practice involves applying pressure to specific points on the body to reduce pain. The pressure stimulates the release of substances such as endorphins, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, and dopamine, resulting in muscle relaxation, regulated blood circulation, and blocked pain signals at nerve endings, effectively reducing the sensation of pain. The aim of acupressure is to alleviate patient discomfort and improve quality of life by reducing the need for analgesics. Acupressure, which falls under the category of therapeutic massage, can be applied using the fingers and palms. According to its core philosophy, illness arises when the balance of energy flowing through body channels, called ""meridians,"" is disrupted. Because acupressure does not involve needles, it is a safe, effective, and economical technique that is easy to learn and apply. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies acupressure as a supportive treatment within its list of ""treatable conditions."" The technique involves applying pressure to the same point for 2-5 minutes. Stimulating specific points promotes the release of cytokines, such as endorphins, which play a role in pain reduction by blocking certain receptors on sensory nerve endings and thus preventing pain perception. Additionally, stimulating acupoints helps establish sympathetic and parasympathetic balance, supporting healthy homeostasis. Studies in the literature have investigated acupressure's positive effects on children's preoperative anxiety, postoperative pain severity, chemotherapy side effects, fatigue, sleep quality, asthma symptoms, and physical stress. In a study examining the impact of acupressure on procedural pain in infants prior to parenteral vaccinations, infants who received acupressure experienced lower pain levels and shorter crying durations. Similarly, a study investigating the effect of acupressure on acute pain during venous catheter insertion in children found that pain severity was lower among children who received acupressure. A systematic review examining the effects of acupressure on child health determined that acupressure is effective in alleviating procedural pain in children. The review emphasized that nurses should incorporate acupressure, a non-pharmacological method, into care practices for effective pain management in children. Despite evidence in the literature supporting acupressure's positive effects on pediatric health, no study has specifically examined its impact on pain and physiological parameters in children undergoing cardiac catheterization. Therefore, this thesis aims to investigate the effects of acupressure, applied before and after cardiac catheterization, on pain levels and physiological parameters in infants.",35,* Infants between 1 month and 12 months * Infants with congenital heart disease * Infants undergoing cardiac catheterization for the first time * Infants undergoing planned cardiac catheterization * Infants without acupressure experience * Infants whose parents volunteered to participate in the study,* Infants with complications during catheterization * Infants followed up in the intensive care unit after catheterization * Infants with any deformity or lesion in the acupressure area * Infants who have not received analgesics after catheterization * Infants who were not given analgesics within six hours before catheterization * Infants with neurodevelopmental disorders * Infants whose parents did not volunteer to participate in the study,False,ALL,1 Month,12 Months,CHILD,N/A

Patients might have slowly worsening symptoms or suddenly face acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), marked by intense difficulty in breathing due to fast-developing lung congestion. This is a serious emergency requiring in-hospital treatment and monitoring. Once stable, patients usually have a phase where symptoms remain constant. But as time goes on, those with heart failure often face more frequent and prolonged episodes of ADHF.

Fluid build-up (pulmonary congestion) in the lungs is a key issue in heart failure, and catching it early helps avoid unexpected hospital stays. Spotting these early signs outside the hospital can be tough, as symptoms aren't always clear. Study investigators are working on a new, non-invasive way to identify these early signs using AI (artificial intelligence) to analyse subtle changes in a patient's voice, cough, and breathing sounds. This tool will act as an early warning for patients and their heart care teams, allowing quicker treatment. This could make heart failure episodes less severe and reduce the need for hospital visits.

This research has two parts. First, a small pilot trial with up to 50 patients. The findings will guide and inform a larger study involving up to 200 patients. From this larger study, investigators will develop the final version of the AI algorithm. The results from the Part A and Part B of this research will guide the investigators in planning a future clinical trial.

Our hypothesis is that in patients with chronic diseases, confinement leads to changes in health behaviours, adherence to pharmacological treatment, lifestyle rules and increased psychosocial stress with an increased risk of deterioration in their health status in the short, medium and long term.

Some messages about the additional risk/danger associated with taking certain drugs in the event of COVID disease have been widely disseminated in the media since March 17, 2020, the date on which containment began in France. This is the case, for example, for corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but also for converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs2). These four major classes of drugs are widely prescribed in patients with chronic diseases, diseases specifically selected in our study (corticosteroids: haematological malignancies, multiple sclerosis, Horton's disease; ACE inhibitors/ARAs2: heart failure, chronic coronary artery disease). Aspirin used at low doses as an anti-platelet agent in coronary patients as a secondary prophylaxis after a myocardial infarction can be stopped by some patients who consider aspirin to be a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Discontinuation of this antiplatelet agent, which must be taken for life after an infarction, exposes the patient to a major risk of a new cardiovascular event.

The current difficulty of access to care due to travel restrictions (a theoretical limit in the context of French confinement but a priori very real), the impossibility of consulting overloaded doctors, or the cancellation of medical appointments, medical and surgical procedures due to the reorganization of our hospital and private health system to better manage COVID-19 patients also increases the risk of worsening the health status of chronic patients who by definition require regular medical monitoring.

Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Lapatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving combination chemotherapy together with trastuzumab and lapatinib after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

During ECMO support, it can be also measured directly in the venous ECMO cannula (SmVO2).

However, due to the difference in tips locations of the venous cannula of ECMO-VA, the central venous catheter and the Swan-Ganz catheter, and rheological issues, the SmVO2, SVO2 and ScVO2 values obtained may be different.

Further we hypothesised that the level of admission flow may also affect the correlation between these different variables.

The aim of this experimental study is to investigate the concordance of the saturation of venous blood collected from these 3 measurement sites.

Once symptomatic with severe AS, outcome is poor unless the valve is replaced surgically or via transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Transthyretin amyloid (ATTR) deposits are common in the heart muscle in up to 25% of octogenarians, and after an asymptomatic period of unknown duration, cause overt heart failure and arrhythmias in a proportion of cases. The prevalence and impact of covert ATTR amyloidosis in elderly individuals with AS are unknown. Detection would avoid misdiagnosis, guide treatment and, potentially, improve outcomes. Recent data have shown that echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), computed tomography (CT), and DPD scintigraphy, can identify ATTR amyloid deposits, but the clinical performance of these various tests is unknown.

This study will investigate elderly patients with symptomatic severe AS using imaging to explore ATTR amyloid in AS and determine its prevalence and impact on outcome.

The investigators aim to recruit a total of 250 patients aged 75 or older being considered for intervention for severe AS. The prevalence of cardiac amyloid will be assessed in three arms (sAVR, TAVI and medical therapy, with a likely patient ratio of 50:150:50), using five investigation modalities - all cohorts (echocardiography and DPD scintigraphy); sAVR cohort (biopsy and CMR); TAVI cohort (EqCT); medical therapy only cohort (as per work-up/trial prior to no intervention decision).

The primary outcome measure is patient mortality. Secondary outcomes measures are major adverse cardiovascular events, length of stay, pacemaker implantation, ECV measured by EqCT and CMR.

This study is drawn from several observations. First, transitions between care settings create elevated risk for poor outcomes and for readmission among older adults leaving the hospital for home largely due to fragmented care and poor communication. Next, while few studies exist that test methods to improve transitions, those available are largely medically focused, using a nurse or advanced practice nurse in their approach. Although evidence exists to support the effectiveness of these models, few have been replicated and none have been integrated into standard health care practice. This may be attributed to several factors including the availability of the needed staff, the lack of existing structures to support these roles, and the costs of implementing these interventions. Finally, a social work driven intervention may provide a replicable mechanism for bridging medical care, addressing psychosocial needs as well as medical needs, and improving linkages with community services while reducing care duplication. This study aimed to test a structured social work transition intervention model to reduce rates of hospital readmission and medical service use while improving patient satisfaction with the care transition process. A randomized pilot study was used to test a social work transitions model designed to improve care provided to frail older adults being discharged from the hospital to return to the community. Eligible patients consenting to participate (n=181) were randomly assigned to either the social work transitions model intervention or usual care. This project was conducted at Huntington Hospital, a 525-bed, nonprofit, community hospital located in Pasadena, California. In an average year, Huntington Hospital has approximately 10,000 older adults discharged from their facility, 44% of who are 80 years old or older. Those randomized to the intervention arm received up to six sessions from the social worker, at least one provided in the home. The social work intervention was designed to overcome common problems following hospital discharge including medication review, discussion and planning around discharge instruction, assistance in scheduling follow up appointments, assessments of psychosocial and other support service needs and provision of linkages to address those needs.

This would reduce the use of diagnostic coronary arteriography, avoid its risks and costs, and guide clinical decisions. Conventional stress echocardiography has poor reproducibility because it relies on qualitative and subjective interpretation. Quantitative approaches based on precise and reliable measurements of myocardial velocity, strain, strain rate and global longitudinal strain have been shown to be able to accurately diagnose myocardial ischaemia. A more accurate test using myocardial velocity imaging was not implemented by ultrasound vendors although it provided an objective measurement of myocardial functional reserve on a continuous scale from normality to severe ischaemia.

The investigators propose an original approach to create a diagnostic software tool that can be used in routine clinical practice. The investigators will extract and compare quantitative data obtained through myocardial velocity imaging and speckle tracking in subjects who undergo dobutamine stress echocardiography.

The data will be analysed using advanced computational mathematics including multiple kernel learning and joint statistics applied to multivariate data across multiple dimensions (including velocity, strain and strain rate traces). This approach will be validated against quantitative coronary arteriography and fractional flow reserve. The results will be displayed as parametric images and placed into a reporting tool.

Background:

Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a marker of sub-clinical coronary atherosclerosis which correlates with higher risk of clinical events. It was already demonstrated that CAC is more prevalent in patients with FH compared with normal individuals. A number of studies demonstrated that plasmatic removal of chylomicrons is defective in patients with atherosclerosis. Despite the fact that is still controversial whether this impairment occurs in patients with HF when compared to normal controls, the kinetics of chylomicrons has not been studied in HF patients with and without atherosclerosis and more important, it is not clear if those changes may be observed in the sub-clinical disease, as reported for CAC in asymptomatic individuals.

Previous studies have demonstrated the inverse correlation among LDL-C levels and the removal of remnants chylomicrons using artificial chylomicrons technique. It is also well known that high doses of more potent statins are more effective to remove chylomicrons from the plasma due to better expression of LDL-C receptors through plasma LDL-C reduction. It was not evaluated yet if the association of ezetimibe and statin, enhancing LDL-C receptors expression in the liver would enhance the efficacy of the monotherapy with statins to remove artificial chylomicrons in patients with HF.

Study design:

Open, randomized, single-blinded study in which twenty six outpatients from the Lipids Clinical Unit at the Heart Institute (INCOR), University of São Paulo, previously diagnosed with FH according to US MED PED criteria, without history of CD and a CAC evaluation by MSCT (Multiple Sensors Computed Tomography) in the previous year will be compared to 26 control individuals matched by age and sex collected from the database of the Lipids Metabolism Laboratory.

Patients will be randomized to receive simvastatin 40 mg as monotherapy or in combination with ezetimibe 10 mg and will undergoing three kinetics studies to demonstrate the effects of simvastatin 40 mg on the kinetics of the chylomicrons along with other laboratorial dosages ( lipid fractions, hepatic enzymes and CK).

The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate if there is any correlation among the reduction of the plasma clearance of chylomicrons by the artificial chylomicrons technique and the presence of sub-clinical atherosclerosis; the secondary endpoint is to evaluate if ezetimibe/simvastatin enhances the effects of simvastatin alone in the removal of chylomicrons in patients with HF.",N/A,* Heterozigous Familial Hypercholesterolemia patients * Age 18 to 70 * Male and Female * Coronary artery calcification,"* Coronary artery disease * Cerebrovascular disease * Diabetes Mellitus * Heart Failure Class III-IV * Thyroid disease * Peripheral Artery disease * Pregnancy, women without anticonceptive method * Kidney disease or calcium disturbs * Thoracic Cancer * Use of Beta Blockers, diuretics, glucocorticoids ,hormone replacement therapy except oral anticonception * Use of lipid lowering drugs for the last six weeks",False,ALL,18 Years,70 Years,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,Brazil

We will recruit 250 patients with an implanted dual-chamber Pacemaker (PM) or an implantable cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) with atrial lead to ensure continuous rhythm monitoring during follow up. At baseline, we will gather clinical and device data of patients. For AF prediction based on surface Electrocardiography (ECG), 24-h Holter ECG monitoring will be performed.

Electrical cardioversion is a technique to convert heart rhythm from AF to normal rhythm. The technique sends out a brief electric shock to the heart through electrodes (paddles or skin patches) applied to the outside of the chest wall. The shock resets the heart rhythm back to its normal pattern.

This technique is practiced at many hospitals, including the Heart Institute, and is not experimental. However no detailed national or international guidelines exist to assist physicians in performing cardioversion. Physicians use a variety of methods. Electrical cardioversion does not always restore normal rhythm. Adjusting the electrical energy dose, changing the electrode position and applying pressure to the electrodes may improve the success rate.

This study will look at the safety and efficacy of a protocol (step by step method) for electrical cardioversion. The protocol prescribes the electrical energy dose, the electrode position and the application of pressure to the electrodes the physician will use. The individual elements of the protocol (energy dose, electrode position and pressure application) are often used by physician in clinical practice but not necessarily in the step by step order.

The purpose of this study is to get all doctors to follow a standard protocol 'the Ottawa AF cardioversion protocol'. We think that using this protocol will improve overall cardioversion success rates. The results of this study may change usual practice in Canada and in other countries.

All supplies, equipment and medications used in the protocol cardioversion are approved by Health Canada.

In the heart, Kv11.1 channels play a role in ending depolarization by causing repolarization. Loss-of-function mutations of HERG cause long QT syndrome, a condition of elongated QT interval that can lead to ventricular tachycardia, syncope and sudden death. Kv11.1 channels are also found in pancreatic α- and β-cells and intestinal L-cells, where they seem to play a role in the secretion of insulin, glucagon and Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1). Carriers of loss-of-function mutations in the HERG gene have showed increased insulin and incretin responses after glucose ingestion and decreased fasting levels of glucagon compared to matched control persons. Blockade of Kv11.1 has shown to augment glucose dependent insulin secretion and decrease low-glucose stimulated glucagon secretion in isolated α- and β- cells. The investigators of this study hypothesize that a blockade of Kv11.1 channels will increase incretin and β cell function and decrease α cell function and thus lead to lower glucose levels in humans after glucose intake. To investigate this, The investigators of this study will perform a randomized, cross sectional study of up to 40 healthy study participants who will serve as their own controls. The study participants will undergo two 6-hours oral glucose tolerance tests, one after intake of a known Kv11.1 blocker (moxifloxacin) and one control oral glucose tolerance test after intake of placebo.

Once reperfusion is achieved in acute myocardial infarction, an intense inflammatory cascade is unleashed.

The architecture of the left ventricle rearranges, leading to ventricular remodeling. The ""homing process""involves stem cell migration to the sites of injury or ischemia, which provides an environment that is favorable to growth and function. This microenvironment is a stimulus for homing and differentiation of stem cells of the appropriate lineage. It increases vascular permeability and expression of adhesion proteins like integrin, along with homing receptors that facilitate the attachment, which is mediated by cell-to-cell contact and chemoattractant release from local tissue injury.The migratory capacity of stem cells might be dependent on natural growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) , stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)and stem cell factor (SCF).The expression of VEGF ,SDF-1 and SCF is highly up-regulated in hypoxic tissue, supporting the hypothesis that these factors may represent homing signals crucial to the recruitment of circulating progenitor cells to assist the endogenous repair mechanisms in the infarcted tissue.

Left atrial fibrosis is increasingly recognized as a fundamental part of the pathomorphological substrate creating an electrophysiological environment needed for electrical conduction heterogeneities. Such identification and treatment of left atrial fibrosis has already entered routine clinical use for RF catheter ablation in an attempt to develop an individualized and tailored treatment strategy. Today, it is unclear what impacts the development, the extent and the localization of left atrial fibrosis in different patients.

A number of genetic risk variants have been described that confer risk of AF and have been widely replicated. This indicates that genetic variants contribute to the risk of the individual to develop AF throughout his life. However, the mechanisms of how genetic variant impact the development of clinical arrhythmias is not yet well understood.

We hypothesize that genetic influences that lead to tissue changes may play a role in the development of the arrhythmia substrate for AF.

This will be achieved through automated analyses of pre-interventional computed tomography (CT) scans.

Severe tricuspid regurgitation is associated with poor patient outcomes. In advanced stages, pharmacological therapy becomes ineffective, and surgical intervention carries a high mortality risk. Given this clinical challenge, catheter-based treatment of the tricuspid valve has become a focal point of research.

One well-established treatment strategy is percutaneous tricuspid valve intervention, which aims to reduce regurgitation either through annuloplasty, leaflet-based edge-to-edge repair or valve replacement. This approach has been shown to significantly decrease the severity of regurgitation, leading to a dramatic reduction in symptom burden and a marked improvement in quality of life.

However, predicting which patients will benefit most from TTVI and determining the optimal technique for each individual remain largely unresolved challenges.

Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered software, such as heart.ai by LARALAB (Munich), enables automated measurement of anatomical structures captured via CT imaging. This technology already allows for rapid and precise assessment of cardiac chambers and the tricuspid annulus throughout the entire cardiac cycle, facilitating a comprehensive three-dimensional evaluation of right heart anatomy.

Both macro- as well as microvasculature undergoes extensive, organ specific maturation. Under normal fetal conditions, microvascular growth drives renal development and continues until 34-36 weeks of gestational age, while retinal vascular growth continues until term age. Studies show that there is association between low birth weight and cardiovascular dysfunction. According to the Barker hypothesis, this is due to nutritional shortage. In extreme preterm birth cases, this growth restriction is observed in neonatal life.

In adult life, this suboptimal growth is associated with impaired renal and (micro)vascular function, hypertension, glucose intolerance and cardiovascular disease.

In fact, the COURAGE trial conducted in 50 centers across United States and Canada documented that drug treatment, coronary interventions or both were not effective solution in coronary artery diseases.

A novel approach has recently been developed, based on the critical role of the potassium (K) content in red-blood-cell in myocardial oxygenation, since oxygen and K binding by hemoglobin (red-blood-cell) occurs simultaneously in blood passing through the lungs, whereas in the organs as the heart, the hemoglobin release both Oxygen and K ions.

This apparently simple mechanisms occurs in human blood in all individuals but could be altered in subjects with acquired or hereditable defect in red-blood-cell K content.

1. Whether exercise RV-arterial coupling at baseline (assessed using hybrid CMRCardioMEMS) predicts development or worsening of exercise RV-arterial uncoupling during follow-up in HFpEF-PH patients.
2. If HFpEF-PH patients developing RV dysfunction have a particular PAP pattern as assessed remotely using the CardioMEMS system. The investigators will determine differential characteristics in CardioMEMS pressure patterns in those developing RV dysfunction versus those who do not develop RV dysfunction, both at rest and during exercise. Hence, HFpEF-PH patients developing RV dysfunction may harbor a plateau of pulmonary artery pressures (as a reflection of RV-arterial uncoupling) despite clinical worsening.

1. Establish a clinical database and a DNA bank for 1000 individuals with AF and 1000 individuals without AF.
2. Directly test the hypothesis that known functional polymorphisms in the coding sequences and the promoter regions of cardiac genes (ion channels and genes known to affect survival in the setting of left ventricular dysfunction) predispose individuals to AF.

Over the past decade, advancing techniques and technologies for gene characterization have yielded significant clues as to the molecular mechanism of certain human heart rhythm disorders. The role of ion channel polymorphisms in subjects with AF is unknown. Similarly, it is also not known whether polymorphisms in other genes have an impact on the risk of AF.

NCT03620266,Effects of Bilberry and Oat Intake After Type 2 Diabetes and/or MI,"Effects of Bilberry and Oat Intake on Plasma Lipid Profile, Inflammation, and Exercise Capacity in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and/or Myocardial Infarction (BioDiaMI): a Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Trial",RECRUITING,2021-09-30,2025-12-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,Myocardial Infarction,Bilberry; Placebo; Bioprocessed oat bran; Combination bilberry/oats,Plasma levels of LDL cholesterol,"Background:

Bilberries from Sweden, rich in polyphenols, have shown cholesterol-lowering effects in small studies, and the cholesterol-lowering properties of oats, with abundant beta-glucans and potentially bioactive phytochemicals, are well established. Both may provide cardiometabolic benefits for patients with manifest chronic cardiometabolic disease, such as type 2 diabets mellitus (T2DM) and myocardial infarction (MI). However, large studies of adequate statistical power and appropriate duration are needed to confirm clinically relevant treatment effects. No previous study has evaluated the potential additive or synergistic effects of bilberry combined with oats on cardiometabolic risk factors.

Design:

This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Our primary objective is to assess cardioprotective effects of diet supplementation with dried bilberry and with bioprocessed oat bran, with a secondary explorative objective of assessing their combination, compared with a neutral isocaloric reference supplement, for patients diagnosed with T2DM and/or MI. Patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to a three-month intervention. The primary endpoint is the difference in LDL cholesterol change between the intervention groups after three months. The major secondary endpoint is exercise capacity at three months. Other secondary endpoints include plasma concentrations of biochemical markers of inflammation, glycaemia, and gut microbiota composition after three months.

Implications:

Secondary prevention after cardiometabolic disease, including T2DM and MI, has improved during the last decades but diabetes complications, readmissions and cadiovascular related deaths following these conditions remain large health care challenges. Controlling hyperlipidemia, hyperglycaemia, hypertension and inflammation is critical to preventing (new) cardiovascular events, but novel pharmacological treatments for these conditions are expensive and associated with negative side effects. If bilberry and/or oat, in addition to standard medical therapy, can lower LDL cholesterol and inflammation more than standard therapy alone, this could be a cost-effective and safe dietary strategy for secondary prevention in high-risk patients or risk prevention in subjects with T2DM.",900,* Confirmed T2DM diagnosis (any treatment modality accepted) and/or within 3 years post STEMI or NSTEMI * Completed coronary angiography/PCI * Male and female subjects ≥18 years * Allocated to atorvastatin at a daily dose of 80 mg (only eligible for patients enrolled up to 7 days post MI and not for T2D subjects) * Written informed consent,"* Emergency coronary artery bypass grafting * \<18 years of age * LDL cholesterol \<2.0 mmol/L * Daily intake or the intent to initiate daily intake of bilberry in any form or daily intake of \>15 g of oatmeal or equivalent * Food allergy/intolerance to gluten, bilberries or legumes * Previous randomization in the BioDiaMI trial * Inability to provide informed consent",False,ALL,18 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,Denmark; Sweden

Acute subdural hematomas (aSDH) are found in up to one-third of patients with severe traumatic brain injury and are associated with an unfavorable outcome in the majority of cases. Chronic subdural hematomas (cSDH) commonly occur in the elderly population which has highest risk for developing cSDH with or without minor head injuries. The combination of the aging population, higher incidence of disease in progressively older patients, and high morbidity and mortality renders SDH a growing problem within Canada with significant health-systems burden. SDH commonly recurs even after successful surgical drainage. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common medical comorbidities in patients with cSDH, especially in the elderly, with an expected doubling of its prevalence by the year 2030. Patients with AF are at recognized risk for stroke, so anticoagulation is indicated for almost all patients. Anticoagulation is held prior to SDH drainage to minimize the risk of intraoperative and early postoperative bleeding. After surgery, the risk of SDH recurrence must be balanced against the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke when deciding the timing of resuming anticoagulation. Currently the decision on when to restart anticoagulation after SDH is made by clinicians on an individual patient basis without any high-quality evidence to guide this decision. The two most common approaches are: 1) early resumption of anticoagulation after 30 days of diagnosis or surgery; and 2) delayed resumption of anticoagulation after 90 days of diagnosis or surgery. However, which of these approaches leads to the best functional outcomes for patients is unclear.

Worldwide, the incidence of atrial fibrillation in men and women is 596.2 per 100,000 and 373.1 per 100,000, respectively. \[1\] The prevalence of AF in China is 0.97%.\[2\] AF increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and death. Ischemic stroke occurs in 25% of hospitalized patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation according to a single-center clinical study in China. \[3,4\] Complications associated with AF place a huge burden on the healthcare system, with an estimated 4.9 billion RMB for patients with AF in China, 89% of which are caused by AF-related strokes.\[5\]

According to the 2018 AHA/ACC/HRS guideline \[6\], catheter ablation was recommended for paroxysmal AF that is symptomatic and refractory or intolerable to at least one class I or III antiarrhythmic drug. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a necessary preoperative examination for catheter ablation of patients with AF in order to exclude thrombus in the left atrium and left atrial appendage (LAA) and to prevent thrombotic complications caused by thrombus shedding during the procedure. However, TEE detection, like gastroscopy, requires transpharyngeal insertion of the probe into the esophagus and should be fasted before it. The TEE probe is thicker than the gastroscope, which can increase the discomfort of the patient during the examination. At the same time, if the patient cooperates poorly during the delivery process, the probe may damage the oropharyngeal or esophageal mucosa, causing complications such as bleeding or perforation.

Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is a new technique that can completely replace TEE in excluding thrombus in left atrium and left atrial appendage. The advantages are that the catheter is inserted from the femoral vein without the discomfort of stimulating the swallowing reflex caused by TEE examination; To avoid complications such as bleeding or perforation caused by injury to oropharynx or esophageal mucosa; It can be used in frail, elderly, pharyngeal or esophageal lesions (eg, ulcers, varices), or intolerable patients. Some studies have shown that ICE is an important test for the diagnosis of LAA thrombosis, especially when thrombus is described as a soft thrombus.

TEE is the gold standard for the detection of thrombi in the LAA before catheter ablation for AF. ICE is used to assist AF ablation; however, ICE is also accurate for LAA visualization and minimizes the complications during procedures\[7\].

The primary purpose of this study aimed at determining whether ICE could replace TEE by minimizing the procedural-related complications but not compromise the detection of thrombi in the LAA.",1200,1.

PAH occurs when the openings in the blood vessels of the lungs get smaller and smaller. These smaller openings can be caused by the following:

* The walls of the arteries tightening
* The walls of the arteries becoming stiff and narrow from an overgrowth of cells The increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries strains the right side of the heart and it begins to fail, causing difficulty breathing and other symptoms. As PAH progresses, symptoms get worse.

There is no cure for PAH, but several medications like endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs), prostacyclin analogues (PCAs) and riociguat, a soluable guanylate cyclase stimulator, are available to help slow the progression of changes in the pulmonary arteries and help reduce symptoms. Riociguat can be taken together with ERAs and PCAs.

* alone
* with ERA
* with PCA
* with ERA and PCA The dosage for each patient will be decided by their doctor.

When the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to your heart muscle become clogged or narrowed, a heart attack may result, or you may feel chest discomfort (angina) - sometimes even while resting. One approach to treating this condition is a balloon procedure known as coronary angioplasty.

The major limitation of coronary angioplasty is renarrowing of the artery (restenosis) in the first six months following the procedure requiring either repeat angioplasty or referral for bypass surgery. Patients with diabetes have always been identified as having higher rates of restenosis and poor outcomes following angioplasty, despite some important scientific advances.

Patients with left atrial posterior wall scar may benefit most from adding PWA to PVI.

For sedation, propofol, midazolam and dexmedetomidine are frequently used. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha 2 receptor agonist, and has sedating and analgesic effect. Compared with propofol and midazolam, it has little or no respiratory inhibition and hemodynamically stable. It also has the effect of reducing delirium in the elderly. Dexmedetomidine has also been reported to prolong the duration of sensory and motor blockade effects of spinal anesthesia. However, several studies have reported that administration of dexmedetomidine in spinal anesthesia increases the incidence of bradycardia.

In a study of healthy young adults, concurrent administration of atropine with dexmedetomidine in spinal anesthesia significantly reduced the frequency of bradycardia requiring treatment. However, in elderly patients, it is often reported that there is little response to atropine in bradycardia, and ephedrine is more effective in treating bradycardia than atropine in the elderly.

The investigators therefore compared ephedrine and atropine as pretreatment to reduce the incidence of bradycardia when using dexmedetomidine as a sedative in elderly patients undergoing spinal anesthesia.",102,* American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification I-II * Undergoing orthopedic surgery under spinal anesthesia,"* Contraindication for spinal anesthesia * Atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter * Cardiac valve disease * Neurologic disease * initial systolic blood pressure in operating room \> 160mmHg",False,ALL,65 Years,100 Years,OLDER_ADULT,"Korea, Republic of"

While it was thought to be mechanical injury to the thoracic duct, recent research demonstrated that there are intrinsically abnormal lung lymphatics in CHD patients, and after open heart surgery, the fluid shifts that occur overwhelms these abnormal lung lymphatics. As a result, postoperative chylothorax occurs. Propranolol has been found to be helpful in resolving postoperative chylothorax very quickly (9 days) in a subset of postoperative chylothorax patients (60%). However, it is not known why some patients respond and some do not. The investigators hypothesize that propranolol is safe to use in this patient population, and that certain clinical factors will predict propranolol response, but more importantly, some clinical factors can be optimize to allow more patients with postoperative chylothorax to respond to and benefit from propranolol.

The choice of treatment for AF is a complex problem, depending on the form (paroxysmal, persistent, permanent) of AF, clinical manifestations of cardiac arrhythmias, associated diseases, the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic drugs. The accumulated data to date indicate an efficacy of the method of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of the paroxysmal form of AF. The RFA procedure does not eliminate the pathological processes that take place during developed AF. This dictates the need to develop and test new technologies and physical rehabilitation programmes for patients.

It is unknown what the optimal endocrine treatment target values are that maximize HRQoL in patients with these syndromes. Therefore the relation between HRQoL and biochemical parameters will be studied in large cohorts of patients with TS and KS. This information will give essential insight that will help to improve endocrine treatment and HRQoL in these patients.

Research objectives: To explore the relationship between biochemical parameters and HRQoL in patients with TS and KS.

Hypothesis: Biochemical parameters are related to HRQoL in patients with TS and KS.

Study design: Cross-sectional, observational, multicentre study Study population: Patients with KS or TS, 18 years or older Methods and procedures: To measure fatigue the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS-20) will be used, for QoL the 5-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-L5) will be used and for stress the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and hair cortisol levels. For patients with KS the anxiety scale from the Liebowitz social anxiety scale (LSAS) will be used to measure social anxiety. To measure the long-term exposure to testosterone in KS patients, testosterone concentrations in hair will be measured. For patients with KS, all questions from the questionnaires will be discussed orally during a visit to the outpatients clinic. One extra tube of blood and a strand of hair will be collected during routine blood withdrawal. All other variables are already part of the standard patient care and are available in patient records. For patients with TS all information including the questionnaires and laboratory values is already available and will be collected from clinical records.

Main study parameters/endpoints: The relationship between different hormonal parameters and HRQoL as measured by questionnaires. The main hormonal parameter that will be investigated in KS is testosterone in hair. For patients with Turner syndrome, free thyroxine (FT4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and liver enzymes, which have already been collected, will be investigated.

Brief Overview: Neurological assessment of comatose cardiac arrest patients (CCAP) is challenging because most of these patients are treated with sedatives and therapeutic hypothermia that prevent complete neurological/clinical assessment. A complete and reliable neurological assessment is needed for patient's long-term function and survival. A poor-quality clinical assessment results in resource-intensive treatment that may not benefit the patient. An ancillary test of head CT scan is often used for additional information. However, this additional information still limits the quality of the assessment. In a small pilot study, we explored an advanced CT scan of brain called CT Perfusion (CTP) relative to clinical assessment in CCAP as a predictor of neurological outcome (severe disability or death) at hospital discharge. The preliminary results suggested that CTP was both valid and reliable, relative to clinical assessment, while meeting many of the criteria of an ideal test (fast, safe, accessible, valid, reliable). This project aims to carry out a fully powered study to confirm these findings.

The goal of this project is to validate CTP for predicting neurological outcome at hospital discharge in CCAP. We will conduct a prospective cohort study to validate the use of CTP in CCAP.

Hypothesis- Computed Tomographic Perfusion (CTP) can reliably diagnose potentially fatal brain injury in CCAP in early stage upon hospital admission, which may or may not be recognized in the usual clinical practice due to inadequate clinical examination.

Primary Objective: To validate CTP, relative to the reference standard of clinical assessment, for characterizing poor neurological outcome at hospital discharge in CCAP.

The main disadvantage of the historical Crush technique is the low success rate of the final kissing balloon inflation. An improvement came with the introduction of double kissing crush stenting aiming for the shorter protrusion and kissing balloon dilation performed before and after main branch stent implantation. The double kissing crush provides a significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events compared to Provisional stenting, Crush, and Culotte techniques. Recently, a novel modified mini-crush technique (controlled balloon-crush) has been introduced to the literature and is one of the most up-to-date crush techniques. The main advantage of this technique over the contemporary mini-crush technique is that the side branch can be easily rewired, and the 1:1 size non-compliant balloon can easily pass through the crushed stent structure in the ostial part of the side branch. The basic rationale of this is that the crushing of the side branch stent is done in a more controlled manner (by slowly deflation of the side branch stent balloon), and this causes less disruption of the stent cells. To date, no data compares the mid-term outcomes of double kissing crush and controlled balloon-crush stenting techniques in patients with complex coronary bifurcation lesions. Hence, this study aimed to determine the clinical results of double kissing crush and controlled balloon-crush techniques under mid-term follow-up.",300,"* Aged \>18 * PCI with either DK-crush or Controlled balloon-crush * Complex coronary bifurcation lesion (Medina 0.1.1, Medina 1.1.1)",* Non-complex bifurcation anatomy * Bail-out 2-stent (reverse modified mini-crush) * ST-elevation myocardial infarction * Cardiogenic shock status * In-stent restenosis * A previous of coronary artery bypass grafting * Implantation of bare-metal stent * End-stage hepatic or renal disease * \<1-year life expectancy,False,ALL,18 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,Turkey

However, direct mucosal damage has not been clearly demonstrated after OHCA. The real incidence of ischemic lesions of GI tract and their potential involvement in the post-CA shock is therefore unknown.

CAD patients also show impaired function and number of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs, adult stem cells) which circulate in adult blood and contribute to endothelial repair. Clinical studies suggest that endothelial function can be improved in CAD patients by consumption of flavanol-rich cocoa. Yet, the mechanism is not known. It is also not known whether flavanol-rich cocoa provides an additive, positive effect in patients who are already receiving the maximal recommended therapies for risk factor modification. Therefore, the researchers propose to perform an investigator-initiated, randomized controlled cross-over study administering flavanol-rich cocoa or a placebo for two months in CAD patients on optimal medical therapy. An improvement of endothelial function as measured by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) will be the primary endpoint of this study. The researchers propose to also measure determinants of FMD such as microvascular response, inflammatory markers, metabolites of nitric oxide, as well as the number and function of EPCs in the blood. Importantly, detailed food questionnaires and plasma flavanols/metabolites will help to further support a causal link between flavanol-intake and improved vascular function.",16,* CAD patients over 18 years of age * Contact university for more details.,* Contact university for more details.,False,ALL,18 Years,100 Years,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,United States

Early identifying and treating heart attacks patients prior to the arriving at the hospital, in those patients who qualify for the ""clot busting"" drugs will lower the size of the heart attack damage. This smaller heart attack will lead to fewer problems with less repeat heart attacks and death in the future.",390,"1.
