Clinical and genetic testing identify those clearly affected by LQTS but in many no disease-causing mutations are found and diagnosis remains uncertain while they are barred from competitive sports. The investigators hypothesize that several cases represent an acquired form of LQTS, akin to drug-induced LQTS, caused by exercise training acting as a trigger or ""second hit"" on a genetic predisposition. The investigators will use next generation sequencing to screen major and minor LQTS genes plus common and rare variants modulating the QT interval in athletes with a QTc\>450ms (cases) and in those with a QTc\<430ms (controls). Thus, the investigators will quantify the presence of LQTS in athletes and will also focus on those who normalize their QTc after detraining, as this points to activation of stretch-receptors.

The angiographically versus IVUS optimization (AVIO) study was performed with (medical device's type )Promus stent, results are promising, but the study was not designed for clinical endpoint.

There is no consensus on IVUS criteria for stent deployment. The MUSIC criteria were widely used in the early 2000, but have limitations for complex long lesions. The AVIO criteria were recently proposed for complex lesions, but these criteria also have some issues and the complexity make their routine use challenging.

We performed a pilot study for long complex lesion analysis using IVUS, in order to define easy to use criteria, applicable for complex lesions in drug eluting stents (DES) era. The new criteria (OPERA) are an adaptation of the MUSIC criteria.

OTELLO study is an ongoing trial sponsored by Boston Scientific Inc, to determine Major Adverse Cardiac Event with the new TAXUS Element stent. 500 patients will be enrolled in the study.

Main question Is IVUS using simplified new criteria beneficial for long (\>28mm) TAXUS element stent deployment?

Study design This study will consist to prospectively include consecutive patients with\>28mm taxus element stent using IVUS. OPERA Criteria for stent deployment will be the objectives to reach. OPERA is an adaptation of the MUSIC criteria for long complex lesion. The patients from the OTELLO study, with the same inclusion criteria, will composed the control group . Population will be matched using the propensity score.

20 to 30 French centers involved in OTELLO study will be contacted for participating in OPERA.

Hypothesis:

Long lesion percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI) have specific characteristics like Diffuse old atheroma Calcifications Discrepancies between prox and distal diameter Infiltration longer than the target lesion Bifurcations Inhomogeneous strength due to the balloon (Laplace law) Primary hypothesis Long Taxus element deployed using IVUS and OPERA criteria have better outcomes than without IVUS

Primary Objectives 38% MACE (SAT, target lesion revascularization (TLR), myocardial infarction (MI), Death) reduction using IVUS and OPERA criteria for Taxus element ≥ 28 mm implantation

Secondary endpoint

1. MACE determination for Taxus element ≥ 28 mm implantation with IVUS and OPERA criteria
2. Safety: procedural Stroke, Urgent cardiac surgery, procedural MI
3. Comparison of IVUS criteria: OPERA, MUSIC, AVIO

Secondary objectives Safety of OPERA criteria Feasibility of using OPERA criteria in non expert IVUS center MACE determination with a 4% margin error for Taxus element ≥ 28 mm implantation with IVUS and OPERA criteria

Methods Inclusion of consecutive patients using IVUS Taxus element ≥ 28 mm in a multicentric study propensity score matched analysis matched for comparison to OTELLO study. (Same inclusion criteria as OTELLO)

Coexisting atrial flutter is common in patients with AF. It is therefore appealing to treat the atrial futters with PFA. The use of PFA for extra-pulmonary ablation, such as linear ablation at the mitral or cavo-tricuspid isthmus (CTI) has been investigated. When PFA is applied near a coronary vessel, acute coronary spasm is a common observation, which has been reported to be reversible and largely mitigated by pre-emptive intravenous or intracoronary nitroglycerine (TNG) injection. A recent clinical study based on qualitative coronary angiogram reported no apparent coronary stenosis 6 months after PFA. However, quantitative measurements were not provided. While acute conduction block is easy to create with pulsed field ablation catheters, the long-term lesion durability is unknown. The circular array pulsed field ablation catheter was shown to be safe and effective in achieving pulmonary vein isolation. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pulsed-field ablation for CTI flutters.

This study will be a multicenter prospective cohort study involving 30 patients undergoing ablation for atrial fibrillation and CTI flutter. The decision for ablation will be a clinical decision based on existing class I and II guideline recommendations.

The atrial fibrillation ablation procedure will be performed as per routine clinical practice. Procedure will be performed with a 3-D electro-anatomical system guidance. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) will be performed with pulsed field ablation with a circular array catheter (Pulse Select system, Medtronic). After confirming PVI, extrapulmonary ablation will be performed per clinically need. CTI ablation will be performed with PFA as planned.

Patient will be managed by usual clinical care after ablation. They will come back for follow up at 3 months for a remapping procedure.

In fact, cerebrothromboemboli without any symptoms have been detected by special imaging procedures called brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in as many as 22% of cases.(1-6) There remains clinical equipoise amongst experts regarding balancing the risks and benefits of continued versus interrupted blood thinning, or ""anticoagulation"" during AF ablation as they pertain to risk of bleed and cerebrothromboemboli prevention, respectively, and the potentially more subtle sequelae of these apparently silent cerebrothromboemboli remain unknown. In fact, both interruption and continuation of anticoagulation during AF ablation are the standard of care. The investigators will perform the first randomized trial of uninterrupted versus interrupted anticoagulation in patients undergoing AF ablation to determine if it mitigates neurologic injury. The objective of this research is to investigate the effect of continued anticoagulation for AF ablation on cerebrothromboemboli, and the neurocognitive sequelae of embolic lesions, which to this point are considered subclinical.

Most prehospital emergency medical services (EMS) agencies use radio-based (audio only) communication between paramedics and physicians to augment this care. However, this communication strategy is inherently limited as the remote physician cannot visualize the patient for accurate assessment and to direct treatment.

The purpose of this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate whether use of a 2-way audiovisual connection with a pediatric emergency medicine expert (intervention = ""telemedical support"") will improve the quality of care provided by paramedics to infant simulator mannequins with life threatening illness (respiratory failure). Paramedics receiving real-time telemedical support by a pediatric expert may provide better care due to decreased cognitive burden, critical action checking, protocol verification, and error correction. Because real pediatric life-threatening illnesses are rare, high stakes events and involve a vulnerable population (children), this RCT will test the effect of the intervention on paramedic performance in simulated cases of pediatric medical emergencies.

The overall screening program will consist of three phases: a home-based testing phase, diagnostic screening phase, and a treatment phase:

* Phase 1: Subjects will be invited for a home-based screening that includes home-based testing; urine collection for detection of elevated albuminuria, and a heart rhythm measurement using a smartphone app for detection of atrial fibrillation.
* Phase 2: Depending on the results on these home-based tests, subjects will be invited for further screening in a diagnostic screening facility. During this visit, physical data will be collected (height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, heart rhythm), blood will be drawn, and urine will be collected for the assessment of parameters that are indicative of a cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes or their risk factors. Participants will receive a questionnaire that include questions on demographics, educational level, disease history, medication use, health literacy, and quality of life.

We are very keen to improve the treatment of this disease and we are measuring the impact of the treatments that we give to patients so that we have a very clear idea of which treatments work best and also which treatments are less successful.

A key part of the treatment is the accurate determination of the causative organism which allows appropriate targeted antibiotic and antifungal medication to be administered.

Accurate antibiotic regimes require detection of the causative organism and its sensitivities to each antibiotic. Antibiotic choice is then based on effectiveness, toxicity, ease of use and national guidelines. The current best technique for identifying bacteria is blood culture where organisms are identified by growing them from blood samples. However, this takes up to 5 days from sampling, resulting in delays to the correct diagnosis. Until this time, treatment requires the use of generic, more toxic antibiotic regimes.

New techniques are emerging to identify causative organisms from blood.

Evaluation of the clinical and economic impact of such imaging lags behind the technology development. Heart failure (HF) represents the final common pathway for most forms of heart disease and morbidity and mortality remain high. There is a need to identify imaging approaches that have a positive impact on therapy decisions, patient outcomes and costs. As well as standard methods to evaluate new and emerging techniques to better test their potential in a clinical management setting.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: to compare the effect of HF imaging strategies on the composite clinical endpoint of cardiac death, MI, resuscitated cardiac arrest and cardiac re-hospitalization (WHF, ACS, arrhythmia). Patients with an ischemic heart disease (IHD) etiology will follow HF imaging strategy algorithms according to the question(s) asked by the physicians (is there ischemia and/or viability), in agreement with their local practices for standard and alternative imaging.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

1. To evaluate the effect of imaging modalities within and between the imaging subgroups (advanced (CMR and PET), PET, MRI and standard (SPECT)) on the primary and secondary outcomes in patients being evaluated either for viability and/or ischemia.
2. To evaluate the impact of adherence to recommendations between modalities on outcomes in patients being evaluated for either viability or ischemia.
3. To compare the effect of HF imaging strategies on:

   1. The incidence of revascularization procedures (PCI, CABG, none) and the interaction of the imaging strategy and types of revascularization on outcomes
   2. LV remodeling: LV volumes, LVEF,
   3. HF symptoms, NYHA class
   4. QOL (MLHFQ, the EQ5D)
   5. The evolution of serum prognostic markers in HF (e.g. BNP, RDW, hs-cTnT, hs-CRP, ST2)
   6. Health economics: Costs estimated through regression analysis and cost effectiveness assessed through decision modeling.
   7. The safety of imaging tests measured by cumulative radiation, adverse reactions to imaging contrast agents and stress testing agents will also be determined.
   8. The evolution of renal function (eGFR) and LV remodeling-associated biomarkers (e.g. PIIINP, OPN).

Most people who die from CHD die of a heart attack. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a term that includes mild heart attacks, as well as other episodes of chest pain that may serve as a warning sign for an upcoming heart attack.

There are many medicines that can help prevent and treat ACS. However, at least 25% of patients don't take their medications as prescribed. When patients don't take their medications, we say they are noncompliant or nonadherent with the treatment.

The period following hospital discharge is a vulnerable time for many patients. Patients are often confused about what to do when they return home from the hospital. Many patients don't take their medications correctly, or they don't take them at all. Patients with poor literacy skills have more trouble than others, because it is harder for them to follow written instructions. Overall, about half of the adults in the U.S. have poor literacy skills. It is important to develop ways to help these adults manage their health better.

The purposes of this research project are 1) to learn more about the relationship between low literacy and medication adherence after hospital discharge, and 2) to test a strategy designed to help patients take their medicines more regularly. We will recruit consenting patients hospitalized with ACS. We will measure their literacy skills, ask questions about how they take their medicines, and measure other related factors like social support and self-efficacy. Patients will then be assigned to 1 of 2 groups. One group will receive only usual care at hospital discharge, which usually includes the nurse and physician briefly reviewing the medication prescriptions. The other group will receive an illustrated daily medication schedule and special, tailored counseling from a pharmacist at their time of discharge. About 1 week after patients leave the hospital we will contact them by phone to ask them questions about how they have been taking their medicines. We will get data from patients records for 6 months to see if the intervention had an impact on their medication compliance, blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes measurements.

If this study is successful, this simple strategy could be implemented by hospitals to improve medication compliance after discharge. This study will also provide more information about how patients' literacy skills affect their medication compliance.",130,"- Present with acute chest pain or angina equivalent, lasting ≥ 10 minutes of suspected ischemic origin, within the previous 24 hours of presentation to the hospital. * Patient must have documented objective evidence of myocardial ischemia based on a or b:",* Previously enrolled in the study * Police custody * Corrected visual acuity worse than 20/60 * Lack of cooperation * Severe hearing impairment * Too ill to participate * Unintelligible speech * Age younger than 18 years * Native language other than English * Psychotic illness * Caregiver administers all medications * Delirium/severe dementia * Does not fill prescriptions at Grady * No regular telephone/address * Not taking chronic medications prior to admission,False,ALL,18 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Vanderbilt University Medical Center,OTHER

It requires opening the thorax in certain indications: coronary artery bypass grafting, valve replacements or plasties, aortic dissection, etc. These different procedures, both pre- and post-op, generate anxiety in the patient, the effects of which can be harmful to the recovery process and general well-being. It can be increased by the resuscitation environment during the immediate postoperative management. This environment also favors the development of delirium. It is possible to improve this environment by using non-drug and inexpensive techniques. Indeed, making the stay in the ICU better while respecting the safety of the patient and the efficiency of the care, could reduce anxiety as well as the appearance of delirium. Studies have been carried out on the effectiveness of music in health care with a positive impact on anxiety and pain.

The proposed study aims to evaluate the implementation of relaxation moments adapted to the resuscitation sector from the day after surgery. They target the senses available and accessible at that moment, such as hearing (relaxing music chosen by the patient will be played) and sight (a multi-effect light projector and a bubble column will be deployed). Environmental stressors will be minimized, while maintaining an optimal level of safety.

The primary objective is to compare anxiety before and after the first session in cardiac surgery patients in the cardiothoracic and vascular surgery (CCTV) resuscitation unit between the group with the usual rest session and the group with the rest session combining soft music and light.

The secondary objectives are based on an evaluation of anxiety over different time periods, patient comfort, occurrence of postoperative delirium, patient pain, average length of stay (LOS).

This is a pilot, comparative, monocentric, randomized, interventional research with minimal risks and constraints in 2 parallel groups. 110 patients will be included over a period of 12 months In the experimental group, once a day, a relaxation session with the association of soft music and light will be proposed by adapting the environment of the patient's resuscitation room.

The increasing number of surgery performed in elderly population results in an increased number of perioperative T2DM-related adverse effects. T2DM has a prevalence of 30-40% in a population undergoing cardiovascular surgery. Cardiac surgery, especially cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is also known to deteriorate cerebral oxygenation.

Furthermore, acid-base balance of patients undergoing CPB can be managed using two main regimes: alpha-stat and pH-stat. The use of pH-stat acid-base management involves maintaining the patient's temperature-corrected pH at a constant level (7.40) and maintaining normocapnia (pCO2 of 40 mmHg). Alpha-stat acid-base management on the other hand is performed by maintaining the ionization state of histidine by keeping the pH stable when a standardized temperature of 37C is used. Therefore, while a constant pH (7.40) and normocapnia (pCO2 of 40 mmHg) are targeted when measured at 37C, the hypothermia applied during CPB will result in a lower pCO2 and in a relative respiratory alkalosis. Previous studies investigating alpha-stat and pH-stat managements demonstrated increased jugular venous oxygen concentrations when pH-stat management was applied.

Therefore, our study is aimed at characterizing the effects of an alpha-stat or pH-stat acid-base management regime on the cerebral oxygenation, parameters of regional cerebral oxygen supply and demand during and following CPB in diabetic patients.

The proprietary surface of Qvanteq's bioactive coronary stent improves the in-growth behavior of the stent in the treated vessel. In-vivo animal studies revealed fast in-growth (similar to BMS), which however is not resulting in excessive tissue overgrowth as observed in BMS but rather has an efficacy profile similar to drug-eluting stent (DES), meaning suppression of tissue overgrowth. This should reduce the risk of restenosis and thrombus formation despite the presence of a short term dual anti platelet therapy (DAPT). Furthermore, prolonged DAPT time as applied with current DES increases the bleeding risk of patients.

The human gut microbiota interacts extensively with the host through metabolic exchange; thereby contribute to a variety of metabolic and immunologic mechanisms in the human body. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and is a major field of interest in microbiota research. There have been several findings that connect the gut microbiota to CAD pathophysiology, but these data relates solely to the interaction between human gut microbiome and cardiovascular risk factors. As far as known , data regarding patients who already developed CAD is lacking.

Aims: To investigate gut microbiota of patients with CAD, thereby allowing the adjustment of personalized treatment by changing the pro-atherosclerotic environment in the gut.

Methods: Study participants will include patients arriving to Rabin Medical Center with suspected CAD. Patients will provide medical, lifestyle, and nutritional questionnaires. Vital signs measurements will be taken as well as fecal samples and/or rectal swabs. Blood samples will be drawn to measure blood chemistry including lipid profile and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) levels. Patients will undergo cardiac CT and/or cardiac catheterization in accordance with the decision of the cardiologist to evaluate and/or treat CAD. Genomic DNA will be extracted from stool samples for Microbiome analysis.

Innovation: The hypothesis is that there is a unique microbiota pattern in patients with coronary atherosclerosis, which may contribute to the pathogenesis and/or expression of CAD. Knowing the unique microbiota in patients with coronary disease, would render it as novel target for treatment, either primary or secondary prevention.

Recent clinical experience with the Arctic Front™ cryoballoon ablation catheter system (Medtronic) suggests that it can be used to isolate the pulmonary veins (PVs) safely and effectively in patients with AF, thereby eliminating the recurrence of AF.

Hypothesis: Our hypotheses are (1) that visualization of real-time pulmonary vein conduction during cryoballoon ablation of atrial fibrillation using a novel spiral circumferential mapping catheter (Achieve™) is feasible and safe, and (2) that procedure and fluoroscopy times decrease with experience.

Objective: The purpose of this study is to assess safety, feasibility, and a learning curve associated with cryoballoon catheter ablation using a novel circular mapping catheter (Achieve™, Medtronic) inserted through the lumen of the cryoballoon in patients with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

This study plan utilizes myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) to explore a) the effects of acute hyperglycemia on myocardial perfusion and coronary flow reserve in individuals with and without DM; and b) the effects of GLP-1 on myocardial perfusion and coronary flow reserve during euglycemia and hyperglycemia in DM. The investigators will recruit individuals with and without DM matched for age, gender and degree of obesity. The investigators will measure myocardial perfusion at rest and during vasodilator stress (to ascertain coronary flow reserve) while subjects are under controlled pancreatic clamp conditions during euglycemia (glucose \~100 mg/dl) and hyperglycemia (glucose \~250 mg/dl) in the presence and absence of concomitant GLP-1 infusion. The investigators believe that the translational significance of their studies is immense, impacting upon both acute and chronic cardiovascular disease manifestations. The effect of glycemic control on cardiovascular outcomes, morbidity and mortality remains an area of active investigation, fueled by the recent conflicting results of several large clinical trials (ACCORD, United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), ADVANCE, VADT). If the investigators find that hyperglycemia is associated with altered myocardial perfusion, the mechanistic implications in the prevention and management of acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases in DM will be groundbreaking.

Identified on echocardiography as Ventricular hypertrophy. The investigation of a Left Ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is the most frequent discovery circumstance of amyloid heart disease.

Pathophysiological mechanisms poorly understood, resulting in late diagnosis. Transthyretin amyloid heart disease (CATTR) is the most common form of cardiac amyloidosis in the West Indies due to an abnormally high frequency of the Val122Ile and Val107Ile mutations of the transthyretin gene in this population. Val122Ile and Val107Ile mutated-transthyretin are the substitution of valine for isoleucine at codon 122 of the TTR gene ( V122I) and at codon 107 of the TTR gene (V107I).

Complications of CATTR are functional changes in heart cells or even death due to mechanical abnormalities (loss of contractility and increased wall stiffness cardiac arousal and conduction disturbances).

Acute subdural hematomas (aSDH) are found in up to one-third of patients with severe traumatic brain injury and are associated with an unfavorable outcome in the majority of cases. Chronic subdural hematomas (cSDH) commonly occur in the elderly population which has highest risk for developing cSDH with or without minor head injuries. The combination of the aging population, higher incidence of disease in progressively older patients, and high morbidity and mortality renders SDH a growing problem within Canada with significant health-systems burden. SDH commonly recurs even after successful surgical drainage. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common medical comorbidities in patients with cSDH, especially in the elderly, with an expected doubling of its prevalence by the year 2030. Patients with AF are at recognized risk for stroke, so anticoagulation is indicated for almost all patients. Anticoagulation is held prior to SDH drainage to minimize the risk of intraoperative and early postoperative bleeding. After surgery, the risk of SDH recurrence must be balanced against the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke when deciding the timing of resuming anticoagulation. Currently the decision on when to restart anticoagulation after SDH is made by clinicians on an individual patient basis without any high-quality evidence to guide this decision. The two most common approaches are: 1) early resumption of anticoagulation after 30 days of diagnosis or surgery; and 2) delayed resumption of anticoagulation after 90 days of diagnosis or surgery. However, which of these approaches leads to the best functional outcomes for patients is unclear.

It is thought to affect as many as 1 in 7 people following COVID-19 infection. It can produce a vast array of symptoms including fatigue, breathlessness, fast heart rate, blood pressure disturbance, temperature disturbance, and dry mouth. Many of these symptoms could be explained by the nervous system being predominantly in a stress or 'fight or flight' response, also known as dysautonomia. One way of assessing whether this is the case is by measuring heart rate variability (HRV). This is the time variation between heart beats and is a marker of how stressed the nervous system is or how strong is the 'fight or flight' response. Heart rate variability can be measured using devices which are worn round the wrist or attach to the chest. An increased variability in heart rate corresponds with a more relaxed nervous system and decreased variability with a more stressed nervous system. Monitoring HRV in real-time and implementing interventions such as a breathing regime to maximise HRV is known as HRV biofeedback. The body can be trained out of the fight or flight response and into the 'rest and digest' mode response of the nervous system in this way and potentially significantly improve symptoms.

However, if problems persist, people can have an operation called catheter ablation therapy, which involves 'burning' small areas of the heart tissue in order to permanently disrupt the problematic electrical pathways driving these arrhythmias.

However, procedure times and complication rates are high, whist success rates are punitively low (\~50% success), largely due to the significant challenge clinicians face in identifying the ideal 'target' to ablate within the patient's heart. In this project, the investigators aim to develop, and clinically validate, an in silico tool that reconstructs a personalised computational model of a patient's heart using advanced MRI data, upon which a virtual 'mapping' procedure is then performed in order to identify (in the model) the optimal ablation target. This pre-procedural planning tool utilises stored information about the patient's specific arrhythmia from their implanted device, ensuring optimal targets are selected.

Certain genetic and familial disease processes are known to weaken the aortic wall resulting in dilation and potential rupture. These aortic complications carry high mortality (\>25%) and current management is orientated towards early detection and preventive treatment. Aortic dilation can also result in aortic valve dysfunction leading to heart failure. The estimated UK incidence of aortic disease per year is around 10 per 100,000 individuals, with 2000 people per year dying from aortic complications.

The 2017-2020 National Adult Cardiac Surgery Audit report identified the number of people receiving surgery for aortic dissection in Scotland is per population proportionately lower compared to England (4.6 per million per year in Scotland vs. 6.6 per million per year in England). The reasons for this are unclear but may relate to the prevalence of aortic disease or a large geographic distribution with compromised access to specialized centres.

Currently surgery is recommended when the aortic diameter exceeds a certain threshold. There are several types of effective surgical procedures, but there is still limited information on their long-term outcomes and the advantage of one procedure over another.

The objectives of this study are to demonstrate the feasibility, acceptability, adoption, sustainability and safety of a of a smartphone-based digital support system in the Belgian healthcare system. It also aims to effectiveness, evaluate the cost of implementation of the system and demonstrate the cost-effectiveness.

The study is multi-center, involving the principal investigator, Dr. Pouleur at Cliniques University Clinics Brussels, and co-investigators from 10 hospitals across Belgium. These physicians will enroll 15 patients on Comunicare's online platform. The patients will then have access to the Comunicare application for 6 months, where they will be asked to answer questionnaires and take their vital parameters. They will also have access to documentation on their pathology and will be able to perform videoconferences with their doctor/nurse via the platform.

Eligible patients are patients discharged from hospital for cardiac decompensation. At the time of inclusion, patients must be in NYHA (New-York Heart association) class II, III, or IV, with an LVEF (ejection fraction ejection fraction) of ≤50%.

The BEDICARE-HF project is based on the standard of care that an HF (heart fealure) patient would receive without being part of any study. No other invasive interventions are additionally planned by the project. The patient data collected by the recruiting physician is secured by Comunicare. These fully anonymized data will be sent to Jessa at the end of the study for statistical and economic economic analysis of the results.

The BEDICARE-HF study will therefore investigate the implementation of a digital support intervention for HF supported by smartphone in a European legislative framework.

The preoperative risk assessment and early detection of POD are very important in the proper management of POD. This is because drug treatment that can prevent or treat POD is limited, and for its prevention and management, a multidisciplinary approach and resource management covering almost all aspects of patient management are required. Therefore, if there is a model that can predict the occurrence of POD, it can be of great help in managing delirium after cardiac surgery through more accurate risk assessment and early detection. In previous studies, aging and cognitive decline before surgery are known as major risk factors for POD, but identification of risk factors before surgery alone is insufficient to predict the occurrence of POD. Cardiac surgery is highly likely to cause pathophysiological changes that can cause POD, because it is associated with hemodynamic instability, cardiopulmonary use, changes in body temperature, and systemic inflammatory response. These pathophysiological changes can be reflected in the data (biosignals) obtained through various monitoring devices during anesthesia. Most of the events that occur during anesthesia are considered to be correctable risk factors of POD, unlike preoperative risk factors, and there is a potential to reduce the occurrence of POD by actively correcting them. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the effect of these intraoperative biosignals on POD. In the delirium prediction model development process, rather than simply dividing the already collected data and using it in the model performance validation process, it is better to conduct model performance validation based on patient data prospectively collected to prevent overfitting and achieve higher predictive performance. Therefore, this study aims to collect prospective data to evaluate the performance of the delirium prediction model after cardiac surgery built using machine learning techniques based on the already collected data including biosignals during anesthesia. After reviewing the medical records from the day of surgery to the period of stay in the ICU, if the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) score is 6 or higher or there is a record of consultation with delirium, it is recorded as POD. After structuring the database through purification, standardization, outlier detection, and sampling of biosignal data generated during surgery, various variables obtained from medical records are collected to construct an evaluation dataset. Using this dataset, the performance of the delirium prediction model built by applying the machine learning algorithm is evaluated through Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis.",200,N/A,N/A,False,ALL,19 Years,100 Years,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,"Korea, Republic of",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Yonsei University,OTHER

This stiffens and thickens the heart muscle over time which makes it less efficient and puts further stress and strain on the other chambers of the heart, leading to heart failure. The commonest form, that affects predominantly the elderly, is called 'wild-type' ATTR amyloid (TTR is the protein that accumulates). In this condition a patient has a 60% chance of admission to hospital each year after diagnosis. There is no current treatment for ATTR amyloid other than using water tablets to reduce excess fluid and prevent more serious fluid build up in lungs and other tissues. Increasing body weight is the most reliable clinical sign of this fluid build up.

Tele-monitoring is the practice of monitoring patients from a distance and has been shown to reduce heart failure admissions and death in patients with heart failure from any cause. Due to reduced access to primary and secondary care during COVID-19 the investigators instigated tele-monitoring of heart failure in ATTR amyloid patients. This appeared to be an effective intervention in the pilot study. The investigators propose to monitor the weight of patients with cardiac amyloidosis at home and intervene where a build up of fluid is observed by telephone discussion with a doctor.

Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) is an intervention by which myocardium threatened by ischemia is exposed to short and repeated sublethal ischemic episodes prior to sustained ischemia (local IPC). A systemic response with protection of more remote organs (remote IPC (rIPC)) also can be induced. We have recently found that the infarct reducing effect can be obtained by obstruction of an extremity even though the remote stimulus is initiated during sustained occlusion of a coronary artery, the so-called remote preconditioning (rPerC). The clinical perspective is now to examine if rPerC can reduce the infarct size in patients with unpredictable ischemia in ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We perform a randomized study where patients en route for pPCI are allocated to either rPerC or a standard treatment to evaluate whether the tissue damage can be reduced.

This is because the amount and types of foods we eat can affect our weight, and because different foods are metabolised (processed) by the body in different ways.

Scientists have also found that the bacteria in our guts (the gut microbiome) affects our metabolism, weight and health and that, together with a person's diet and metabolism, could be used to predict appetite and how meals affect levels of sugar (glucose) and fats (lipids) found in blood after eating. If blood sugar and fat are too high too often, there's a greater chance of developing diseases such as diabetes.

The gut microbiome is different in different people. Only 10-20% of the types of bacteria found in our guts are found in everyone. This might mean that the best diet to prevent disease needs matching to a person's gut microbiome and it might be possible to find personalised foods or diets that will help reduce the chance of developing chronic disease as well as metabolic syndrome.

Echocardiography is the most common form of cardiac imaging and is routinely and frequently used for diagnosis. However, there is often subjectivity and heterogeneity in interpretation. Artificial intelligence (AI)'s ability for precision measurement and detection is important in both disease screening as well as diagnosis of cardiovascular disease.

Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a rare, underdiagnosed disease with targeted therapies that reduce morbidity and increase life expectancy. However, CA is frequently overlooked and confused with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Some estimates suggest that CA can be as prevalence as 1% in a general population, with even higher prevalence in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and other cardiac symptoms that might prompt echocardiography.

AI guided disease screening workflows have been proposed for rare diseases such as cardiac amyloidosis and other diseases with relatively low prevalence but significant human impact with targeted therapies when detected early. This is an area particularly suitable for AI as there are multiple mimics where diseases like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloidosis, aortic stenosis, and other phenotypes might visually be similar but can be distinguished by AI algorithms. The investigators have developed an algorithm, termed EchoNet-LVH, to identify cardiac hypertrophy and identify patients who would benefit from additional screening for cardiac amyloidosis.",500,* Patients receiving an echocardiogram that is determined to be suspicious by EchoNet-LVH,* Patients that decline consent * Patients receiving an echocardiogram that is determined to be not suspicious by EchoNet-LVH,False,ALL,22 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,OTHER

The pathomechanism for the development of anemia in CHF is not well understood. Impairment of iron homeostasis is discussed to be one of the major triggers in anemia of chronic disease. Hepcidin was recently described as the central regulator of iron homeostasis.

Main hypothesis: Plasma hepcidin levels are altered in anemic CHF patients compared to non anemic controls and might be a main contributing factor of anemia in CHF.

Iron regulator-hypothesis High levels of cytokines in CHF patients cause up-regulation of hepcidin, which in turn leads to low iron uptake causing anemia. In this case venous hepcidin and hemoglobin concentrations should both correlate with cytokine levels.

Erythropoietin regulator-hypothesis Dysregulation of the erythropoietin system results in anemia, which represses hepcidin. This leads to a negative correlation between hemoglobin and hepcidin in plasma.

Methods: 100 consecutive patients diagnosed with systolic CHF will be prospectively included in the study. Iron status will be assessed and hepcidin, erythropoietin as well as interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and soluble TNF alpha receptor levels will be measured by ELISA.

Patients will be followed up for one year and mortality, rehospitalization and worsening of CHF will be documented.",100,N/A,N/A,True,ALL,18 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,Austria,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Medical University of Vienna,OTHER

Traditional echocardiographic measures are insensitive and consequently cardiomyopathy often goes undiagnosed until late stages of disease. Myocardial deformation imaging represents a promising means to identify early dysfunction, but to date there have been no large studies using strain or strain rate to assess cardiac function in children with HIV and to establish predictors of worse cardiac function such as viral burden and ART regimen. These studies are critically important as earlier diagnosis and intervention represent the best means to alter the course of HIV-associated cardiomyopathy.

Objectives: To determine the association of biomarker levels, myocardial deformation, and viral load level history in HIV infected children attending Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) clinic.

Design: A cross-sectional study on clients attending HIV clinic, MTRH. Setting: Module 4 HIV clinic at MTRH in western Kenya, Africa. Population: HIV-infected children attending clinic in 2017 - 2018 Main Measures: Echocardiographic function assessment, Age, Immune status, other illnesses, ART status.

Conclusions: The study will explore the NIH/HIV High Priority Target area of HIV-associated cardiac co-morbidities and will enhance understanding of the relationship between cardiac function and viremia. The investigators expect to be able to reliably define a subset of children with worse cardiac function by risk factors: specific ART regimens, less time virally suppressed, and increased BNP biomarker.",643,* Attending HIV care clinic for regular follow up visit * \< 14 years old * Diagnosed HIV prior to age 10 * caregiver gives consent,* unable to cooperate with echocardiogram,False,ALL,1 Month,14 Years,CHILD,Kenya,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Duke University,OTHER

Aortic stenosis increases left ventricular pressure overload. Cardiac deposits have been observed in AS and the amount of these deposits has been correlated to post-surgical outcome. As they are strong echocardiographic and cardiac MRI imaging similarities between CA and AS, the investigators hypothesized that the deposit observed in AS is transthyretin amyloid deposit. The investigators objective is to demonstrate that amyloid deposit is associated with poor outcomes following aortic stenosis surgical valve replacement.

Materiel and methods: 180 patients with indication for surgical aortic valve replacement will be recruited prospectively and consecutively in 5 French centers. A replicative study will be performed in one Austrian center. Echocardiography, cardiac MRI and bone scintigraphy will be performed prior to surgery. During surgery, a basal LV septum biopsy will be collected for determination and quantification of interstitial deposits using specific staining which will be performed in a blind fashion. Clinical outcomes will be recorded during the hospitalization period following the surgery and at 1 year. Alive and re-hospitalization status will be determined. Patients will be classified according to the presence or not of amyloid deposits.

Expected results and impact: This study will emphasize how pressure overload stress accelerates and magnifies amyloid deposition usually known to be related to cardiac aging process. It will develop reliable imaging tools and markers to detect cardiac amyloid deposition.

Bilberries from Sweden, rich in polyphenols, have shown cholesterol-lowering effects in small studies, and the cholesterol-lowering properties of oats, with abundant beta-glucans and potentially bioactive phytochemicals, are well established. Both may provide cardiometabolic benefits for patients with manifest chronic cardiometabolic disease, such as type 2 diabets mellitus (T2DM) and myocardial infarction (MI). However, large studies of adequate statistical power and appropriate duration are needed to confirm clinically relevant treatment effects. No previous study has evaluated the potential additive or synergistic effects of bilberry combined with oats on cardiometabolic risk factors.

Design:

This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Our primary objective is to assess cardioprotective effects of diet supplementation with dried bilberry and with bioprocessed oat bran, with a secondary explorative objective of assessing their combination, compared with a neutral isocaloric reference supplement, for patients diagnosed with T2DM and/or MI. Patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to a three-month intervention. The primary endpoint is the difference in LDL cholesterol change between the intervention groups after three months. The major secondary endpoint is exercise capacity at three months. Other secondary endpoints include plasma concentrations of biochemical markers of inflammation, glycaemia, and gut microbiota composition after three months.

Implications:

Secondary prevention after cardiometabolic disease, including T2DM and MI, has improved during the last decades but diabetes complications, readmissions and cadiovascular related deaths following these conditions remain large health care challenges. Controlling hyperlipidemia, hyperglycaemia, hypertension and inflammation is critical to preventing (new) cardiovascular events, but novel pharmacological treatments for these conditions are expensive and associated with negative side effects. If bilberry and/or oat, in addition to standard medical therapy, can lower LDL cholesterol and inflammation more than standard therapy alone, this could be a cost-effective and safe dietary strategy for secondary prevention in high-risk patients or risk prevention in subjects with T2DM.",900,* Confirmed T2DM diagnosis (any treatment modality accepted) and/or within 3 years post STEMI or NSTEMI * Completed coronary angiography/PCI * Male and female subjects ≥18 years * Allocated to atorvastatin at a daily dose of 80 mg (only eligible for patients enrolled up to 7 days post MI and not for T2D subjects) * Written informed consent,"* Emergency coronary artery bypass grafting * \<18 years of age * LDL cholesterol \<2.0 mmol/L * Daily intake or the intent to initiate daily intake of bilberry in any form or daily intake of \>15 g of oatmeal or equivalent * Food allergy/intolerance to gluten, bilberries or legumes * Previous randomization in the BioDiaMI trial * Inability to provide informed consent",False,ALL,18 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,Denmark; Sweden,"Ole Frobert, Prof",CONTACT,+46 19 602 543,ole.frobert@regionorebrolan.se,"Ole Frobert, MD, PhD",N/A

The investigators will determine:

1. Whether exercise RV-arterial coupling at baseline (assessed using hybrid CMRCardioMEMS) predicts development or worsening of exercise RV-arterial uncoupling during follow-up in HFpEF-PH patients.
2. If HFpEF-PH patients developing RV dysfunction have a particular PAP pattern as assessed remotely using the CardioMEMS system. The investigators will determine differential characteristics in CardioMEMS pressure patterns in those developing RV dysfunction versus those who do not develop RV dysfunction, both at rest and during exercise. Hence, HFpEF-PH patients developing RV dysfunction may harbor a plateau of pulmonary artery pressures (as a reflection of RV-arterial uncoupling) despite clinical worsening.
3. Whether extraction of raw pressure data obtained by the CardioMEMS system is feasible and enables post-processing using machine learning methods (artificial intelligence) for deep phenotyping of patients (in addition to clinical evaluation of pressure waveforms).

Studies designed to attenuate or alleviate CI in persons with HF are limited, and evidenced based guidelines for screening and provision of care are practically nonexistent. Improvement in cognition has been reported following some therapies in HF and is thought to be the consequence of enhanced cerebral perfusion and oxygenation, suggesting that CI may be amenable to intervention in this population. Exercise is documented to increase cerebral perfusion and oxygenation by promoting neuroplasticity and neurogenesis, and, in turn, cognitive functioning. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key mechanism underlying the effect of exercise, but most studies of BDNF have not included individuals with CI or chronic illness populations, and its relationship to cognitive outcomes in HF is unknown. Cognitive retraining techniques, originally developed to treat traumatic brain injury, have also shown efficacy in broader neurologically-affected conditions and may provide added benefit to that of exercise. Animal studies suggest exercise and plasticity-based cognitive training could act synergistically through different neural mechanisms to have a more pronounced and positive impact on cognitive outcomes than either approach alone; but this has not been previously tested as an intervention to improve CI. The proposed feasibility study is designed to test the acceptability and limited efficacy of a combined exercise (Ex) and cognitive training (CT) program to improve CI in stable NYHA class II and III HF patients compared to either exercise alone or a no-intervention, attention-control group. Findings will be used to support the development of a future, large scale study to test the efficacy of this intervention to improve cognitive functioning, quality of life, and physiological markers of improved brain function in HF.

Guidelines recommend surgical valve repair of severe TR in symptomatic patients. Despite its association with excess mortality and morbidity, TR has been relatively neglected and is severely undertreated. In particular this is because isolated tricuspid surgery remains associated with high mortality rates, and thus, patients with severe TR are often deemed inoperable due to severe co-morbidities and frailty. In recent years, percutaneous CE-mark approved techniques for transcatheter tricuspid valve treatment (TTVT) have emerged as alternatives to surgery. These include (I) transcatheter annuloplasty devices (Tricuspid Cardioband) and (II) transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TriClip, PASCAL).

In HCM, pathological remodeling of the left ventricle involving myocardial fibrosis is likely a major contributor to cardiac dysfunction and also a nidus for the generation of ventricular arrhythmias. Serum markers of collagen turnover have been shown to reliably reflect the magnitude of myocardial fibrosis in a variety of cardiovascular diseases. In addition, aldosterone antagonist drugs have been shown to decrease fibrous tissue formation in the myocardium in certain pathologic cardiovascular states in which aldosterone production is increased. In HCM, aldosterone production is up-regulated and has been implicated in the formation of myocardial fibrosis.

Therefore, the specific aims of this proposal are to:

1. assess serum markers of collagen turnover at baseline and correlate these findings with a variety of clinical and morphologic disease parameters
2. examine the effects of a 12-month treatment with the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone on magnitude of fibrosis as measured by serum markers of collagen turnover as well as changes in clinical and morphologic disease parameters.
3. explore the effects of a 12-month treatment with aldosterone antagonist spironolactone on heart failure status, diastolic function, arrhythmic burden, and total LV mass and quantity of fibrosis by CMR.

The results of this proposal will offer important insights into the clinical significance of myocardial fibrosis in this primary genetic cardiomyopathy.

The thickened muscle and the obstruction of blood flow are believed to cause chest discomfort, breathlessness, fainting, and a sensation of heart pounding. Treatment options for children with HCM include medicine, heart operation, and cardiac transplantation. However, there is no evidence that medicine prevents further thickening of heart muscle; operations carry the risk of death; and donor hearts are not always available. Several studies have shown that pacemaker treatment reduces the obstruction and improves heart complaints in patients with HCM. This study investigates further the efficacy of pacemaker treatment in children.

Patients will have exercise tests after treatment with beta blocker and verapamil and will be eligible for the study if heart complaints or reduced exercise performance continue.

A pacemaker that treats slow heart rhythms will be inserted. The patient will be sedated and local anesthesia will be administered to numb the area. The procedure takes about an hour.

The study will last two years. Patients will be placed on one of two pacemaker programs for the first year and another the second year. At 3- and 6-month follow-up visits, a pacemaker check and echocardiogram will be performed. After 1 year, patients will be admitted to NIH for 2 to 3 days for exercise tests, echocardiogram, and cardiac catheterization. Also, the pacemaker will be changed to the second program. At 15- and 18-month follow-up visits, a pacemaker check and echocardiogram will be performed. After 2 years, patients will again be admitted for 2 to 3 days for exercise tests, echocardiogram, and cardiac catheterization. A pregnancy test will be given to females of child-bearing age before each cardiac catheterization and electrophysiology study.

At the end of the study, the pacemaker will be set to the program that worked better.

Risks of pacemaker insertion include lung collapse, infection, blood vessel damage, bleeding, heart attack, and death. Risks of cardiac catheterization include infection, bleeding, blood clots, abnormal heart rhythms, perforation of the heart, need for surgery, and death.

We aim to determine the effect of CRT-D or CRT-P implantation in non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure patients.

The reason why we initiated this trial is the lack of evidence-based treatment for the significant number of these patients. In these patients, 5-year mortality remains as high as 20% despite recent therapeutic advances. Based on currently available evidence, because of a significant decrease in mortality due to modern pharmacotherapy, it is not certain which of these patients should receive a CRT-P and who should receive a CRT-D. No dedicated and adequately powered trial has addressed this important question.

We hypothesize that patients with symptomatic HF, LVEF ≤35%, without left ventricular mid-wall fibrosis on LGE-CMR, will not benefit from CRT-D implantation compared with CRT-P only implantation.

If our hypothesis is confirmed, this could provide evidence for the management of these patients with a significant impact on common daily praxis and health care expenditures.

We aim to enroll 600 patients in the trial. 924 patients are needed to be screened for these 600 patients to be randomized.

Patients with non-ischemic HF visiting an out-patient department and possibly eligible for the trial will have their pharmacotherapy optimized.

Patients with a significant amount of fibrosis will be excluded from the study and treated according to local practice with an emphasis on ICD implantation to prevent SCD.

After fulfilling all eligibility criteria, including maximally tolerated pharmacotherapy, subjects will be randomized by the physicians who enrolled them in a 1:1 ratio to receive CRT-D or CRT-P implantation.

Clinical presentations are multiple, including chest-pain, heart failure and a broad spectrum of arrhythmias. In turn, outcome is largely unpredictable, ranging from mild self-limiting disease, to chronic stage and progressive evolution towards dilated cardiomyopathy, to rapid adverse outcome in fulminant forms. Subsequently, myocarditis is often underdiagnosed and undertreated, and optimal diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are still to be defined. This study, both retrospective and prospective, originally single-center and subsequently upgraded to multicenter, aims at answering multiple questions about myocarditis, with special attention to its arrhythmic manifestations.

Optimal diagnostic workflow is still to be defined. In fact, although endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is still the diagnostic gold standard, especially for aetiology identification, it is an invasive technique. Furthermore, it may lack sensitivity because of sampling errors. By converse, modern imaging techniques - cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in particular - have been proposed as alternative or complementary diagnostic tool in inflammatory heart disease. Other noninvasive diagnostic techniques, like delayed-enhanced CT (DECT) scan or position emission tomography (PET) scan, are under investigation.

Biomarkers to identify myocarditis aetiology, predisposition, prognosis and response to treatment are still to be defined.

Arrhythmic myocarditis is largely underdiagnosed and uninvestigated. Importantly, myocarditis presenting with arrhythmias requires specific diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic considerations. At the group leader hospital, which is an international referral center for ventricular arrhythmias management and ablation, a relevant number of patients with unexplained arrhythmias had myocarditis as underlying aetiology. The experience of a dedicated third-level center is going to be shared with other centers, to considerably improve knowledge and management of arrhythmic myocarditis.

The role of CMR, as well as alternative noninvasive imaging techniques, in defining myocarditis healing is a relevant issue. In particular, optimal timing for follow-up diagnostic reassessment is still to be defined, in patients with myocarditis at different inflammatory stages, either with or without aetiology-dependent treatment.

Uniformly-designed studies are lacking, to compare myocarditis among different patient subgroups, differing by variables like: clinical presentations, myocarditis stage, associated cardiac or extra-cardiac diseases, aetiology-based treatment, associated arrhythmic manifestations, diagnostic workup, and devices or ablation treatment.",20,* Written informed consent. * Age \&lt; 18 years. * Clinically suspected myocarditis. * Enrollment performed by one of the participating Centers.,* Absence of written informed consent. * Age \&gt; 18 years (adults),True,ALL,0 Years,17 Years,CHILD,Italy,"Giovanni Peretto, MD",CONTACT,+39 0226437482,peretto.giovanni@hsr.it,Scientific Institute San Raffaele,N/A

This process helps reoxygenate the previously hypoxic myocardium, potentially preventing further myocardial cell death. However, despite its benefits, reperfusion therapy, including primary PCI, can also lead to reperfusion injury, which may worsen myocardial damage, increase infarct size, and negatively impact patient outcomes. One of the key contributors to reperfusion injury is reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can induce oncosis, necrosis, and apoptosis, ultimately promoting cell death, myocardial remodeling, left ventricular systolic dysfunction and poorer clinical outcomes. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), widely known for its mucolytic properties, has also been recognized for its antioxidant and cardioprotective effects. By reducing oxidative stress, NAC has been shown to decrease oncosis, necrosis, and apoptosis, as evidenced by lower levels of malondialdehyde, IL-6, troponin, caspase-3, and major adverse cardiac events in STEMI patients. However, existing research on NAC has only explored oral and intravenous administration. Given that reperfusion injury occurs rapidly, an optimal approach would involve delivering cardioprotective agents directly to the target site, specifically coronary artery endothelial cells. To date, no studies have directly investigated the effects of intracoronary NAC administration in STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI.",32,N/A,N/A,False,ALL,30 Years,60 Years,ADULT,Indonesia,"Ahmad Yasa, MD",CONTACT,8122657863,dr.ahmadyasa@gmail.com,"dr.

Half of these will have HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

HFpEF has been associated with high rates of morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditures. Its pathophysiology remains poorly understood, and positive medication trial results to date have been rare.

Inflammation is strongly associated with a profibrotic activation in HFpEF, which is in turn associated with the severity and prognosis of the disease.

Colchicine is a potent anti-inflammatory drug which properties relate to the suppression of tubulin polymerization and inflammasome inhibition, thus reducing the production of IL-1β and IL-18.

According to the American Diabetes Association, transition from the acute care setting is a high-risk time for all patients, but tailored support specific to diabetes is scarce in that period. The investigators developed an intervention by a diabetes nurse to help diabetic patients reduce distress after their first ACE. The intervention is based on Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory, Leventhal's Common Sense Model, and on results of focus groups which were conducted to define the needs and wishes of type 2 diabetes patients and their partners regarding professional support after an ACE. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention to reduce distress. The hypothesis is that patients who receive the intervention will have less diabetes related distress compared to the control group.

Methods/Design: Randomized controlled trial. Patients will be recruited directly after discharge from hospital. A diabetes nurse will visit the patients in the intervention group (n = 100) within three weeks after discharge from hospital, two weeks later and two months later. The control group (n = 100) will receive a telephone consultation. The primary outcome is diabetes related distress, measured with the Problem Areas in Diabetes questionnaire (PAID). Secondary outcomes are quality of life, anxiety, depression, HbA1c, blood pressure and lipids. Mediating variables are self-management, self-efficacy and illness representations. Variables will be measured with questionnaires directly after discharge from hospital and five months later. Biomedical variables will be obtained from the records from the primary care physician and the hospital. Differences between groups in change over time will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.

Recently a study suggested that RA patient have abnormal myocardial inflammation during a disease flare and that this is improved with anti-inflammatory treatment. This study is aimed at describing the prevalence of myocardial inflammation in patients during active RA disease flares and comparing that with RA patients who are in remission.

In the routine clinical practice, orthotopic heart transplantation patients receive periodic cardiac catheterization for early detection of allograft vascular disease.

The coronary angiography of these patients is characterized for several technical difficulties, generally related to the presence of the aortotomy with anomalous implantation of the coronary ostia and to the orthotopic position of the allograft. For these reasons, trans femoral approach is usually preferred. In the last two decades, trans radial approach for coronary angiography emerged to be effective, safe and able to improve patient comfort. However, there is no universal consensus on the optimal choice of radial access from either the left or the right artery. Currently, this choice is largely dependent on the operator's preference. The trans right radial approach is generally preferred in routine clinical practice mainly due to its easier catheter manipulation for the operators from patient's right side, and the current design of radial compression devices for the right wrist in medical market. As such, a major barrier to prevent the wide adoption of the left radial access lies in some difficulty to reach the left wrist leaning over the patient, particularly for shorter operators or in obese patients. However, a great deal of attention has been recently directed toward the trans left radial access, as it has an important anatomical advantage due to the vascular anatomy of epiaortic vessels with a straighter route to the left coronary ostium, which could also reduce the risk of cerebrovascular complications.

However, no data are available about the performance of trans left radial or trans-right radial approach in coronary angiography orthotopic heart transplantation patients.

These results in favour of a routine invasive strategy in STEMI patients suggest a potential change to the current approach of awaiting the response to treatment in patients receiving fibrinolysis, and draw the attention to the potential need for an appropriate network organization with adequate first hospitalization treatment (spoke) and prompt transfer to centres with 24/7 PCI capabilities (hub). The recent ESC (3) and ACC (4) guidelines on STEMI are consistent with the early ESC PCI Guidelines, recommending that angioplasty after fibrinolysis should be performed within a time-window ranging between 3 and 24 hours after successful lytic administration (level evidence IIA). The reason for the weighting of the recommendation is due to the heterogeneity of trial results with different planned-revascularization strategies, variable primary end-points definitions, and small individual trial sample sizes. Therefore, a consistent analysis of single patient dataset from all published randomized trials would be of value to better define the magnitude and duration of clinical benefit of the routine invasive strategy after lytic treatment as well as the potential optimal timing of such a strategy.

Despite being predominantly younger patients, survival rates among pregnant women are poor with one case series reporting a survival rate of 6.9%. Resuscitation of a pregnant women can be challenging when compared to non-pregnant adults. Aggressive maneuvers (perimortum cesarean section) and multidisciplinary team efforts are required because of the anatomical and physiological changes associated with pregnancy, in addition to taking care of two patents (mother and fetus). The first 5 minutes from the onset of cardiac arrest are the most crucial in terms of neonatal survival. In maternal deaths involving acute cardiac arrest, advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) must be rapidly administered. Previous work suggests deficits in cardiac arrest care during maternal cardiac arrest. The current literature fails to adequately quantify the severity, timing and frequency of errors made during maternal cardiac arrest care amongst interprofessional healthcare teams.

1. to examine critical delays by measuring the median duration of the interval between when a resuscitation maneuver was indicated and when it was initiated by first responders ( nursing staff at L\&D attending the patient).
2. to describe the type and frequency of resuscitation errors identified as deviations from AHA guidelines during obstetric cardiac arrest.

NCT01643031,Effect of Modifying Anti-platelet Treatment to Ticagrelor in Patients With Diabetes and Low Response to Clopidogrel,Effect of Modifying Anti-platelet Treatment to Ticagrelor in Patients With Diabetes and Low Response to Clopidogrel,UNKNOWN,2012-08,2014-10,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,Diabetes Mellitus; Coronary Disease,Ticagrelor; Continued clopidogrel,"Rate of elevation of troponin or CK-MB (above the upper limit of normal, and above 3 times the upper limit of normal) measured 20-24 hours after the PCI.","In recent years numerous studies have shown that the response of patients to the anti-platelet drug clopidogrel is widely variable. Furthermore, patients who do not respond well to the drug (""resistant"") have been shown to be at increased risk to develop cardiac events, including myocardial infarction and mortality. It thus seems reasonable to test the efficacy of the drug (by platelet function tests) and modify treatment accordingly. However, a large study that examined a strategy of routine testing of clopidogrel response in thousands of patients (GRAVITAS study) did not show any clinical benefit. This study was limited, however, by a very low event rate (2.3%), and by the strategy employed to treat patients with low response (increasing the clopidogrel dose), which is currently known to be ineffective in many patients with low response. To overcome these limitations the investigators plan to examine a high risk population - patients with diabetes planned to undergo coronary angiography - and to treat clopidogrel low responders by switching their treatment to the potent anti-platelet drug ticagrelor, which has been shown to overcome clopidogrel low response.

The investigators hypothesize that patients with diabetes and low response to clopidogrel will benefit clinically from switching therapy to ticagrelor. The main endpoint of the study will be the risk of myocardial enzyme elevation following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); a marker which has been strongly associated with poor clinical outcome.

The aim of the study is, therefore, to assess whether a strategy of monitoring platelet function during clopidogrel treatment in patients with diabetes undergoing PCI, and modifying treatment to ticagrelor in patients with low response, will be associated with reduced risk of myocardial enzyme release.

The investigators plan to enroll patients with treated diabetes, planned to undergo coronary angiography. Patients with acute or recent myocardial infarction will be excluded. They will be tested for response to clopidogrel by the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay (either on chronic clopidogrel treatment or 12-24 hours after receiving 300 mg clopidogrel). Patients with low response to clopidogrel (≥ 208 PRU) will be randomized to either continued treatment with clopidogrel (75 mg/day), or switching of treatment to ticagrelor (90 mg twice a day) for 30 days (followed by continued clopidogrel therapy). The primary endpoint will be the rate of troponin of CK-MB (cardiac enzymes) measured 20-24 hours after the PCI. Secondary endpoints will be the occurrence of adverse clinical endpoints - myocardial infarction, need for urgent revascularization or mortality at 30 days. The investigators aim to enroll 100 patients in each study group (ticagrelor vs. continued clopidogrel). Assuming a clopidogrel low response rate of 40% among patients with diabetes, about 500 patients would have to be screened to identify 200 patients with low response.",500,-,-,False,ALL,30 Years,80 Years,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,Israel,Hagar Medan,CONTACT,972-3-9376442,hagarme@clalit.org.il,Rabin Medical Center,N/A

However, β-blocker therapy remains underutilized in clinical practice because of concerns of potential adverse effects such as a reduced inotropic state, which might result in acute congestive heart failure or hypotension. Therefore, additional treatment with a positive inotropic agent might be needed. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDEIs) offer a favourable pharmacological profile in this setting and stimulate cardiac function in the absence of the β-adrenergic receptor.

We hypothesize that the combination of PDEI and β-blocker therapy would decrease perioperative plasma concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in patients requiring major vascular surgery.

Deaths associated with ectopic pregnancy have declined, though approximately 75% of deaths in the first trimester and 9-13% of all pregnancy-related deaths are associated ectopic pregnancy.

Medical management with systemic methotrexate administration avoids the inherent morbidity of anesthesia and surgery is cost-effective, and also offers success rates comparable to surgical management, with no loss in future potential fertility.

However, although medical management using methotrexate is used commonly, there is no solid consensus regarding dose protocol. Currently, there are three methotrexate protocols for the treatment of an ectopic pregnancy, ""multi-dose"", ""single-dose"", or ""two-dose"". Among them, the multi-dose protocol includes the administration of 4 methotrexate doses alternating with leucovorin (rescue regimen). As a result of the multiple dosing of methotrexate, side effects are more common. In contrast, the advantages of the single-dose protocol include elimination of a rescue regimen, lower incidence of adverse effects, and better compliance. However, the single-dose protocol was found to be associated with a considerably lower success rate as compared with the multi-dose protocol (88% versus 93%) in a recent meta-analysis. The two-dose protocol, which it balances efficacy and safety/convenience, was described as a cross between the multi-dose and single-dose protocols.

This causes debilitating symptoms including shortness of breath, blackouts and chest pain. Current treatments are not ideal as the medication is often poorly tolerated or ineffective.

People with HOCM can often have an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) to shock them out of dangerous arrhythmias. ICD's can also be used as pacemakers and are a promising treatment option, since they can alter the sequence of the heart muscle contraction thereby relieving the obstruction to the blood flow, making it easier for the heart to pump.

The study will recruit patients who already have an ICD/pacemaker or who are scheduled to have an ICD / pacemaker implanted. For patients who are due to have a device implanted high precision haemodynamic, echocardiographic and electrical measurement techniques will be used to assess whether adjusting the position of the pacing lead (at the time of implant) can bring about changes in LVOT gradient and blood pressure.

Children with congenital heart disease step from pediatric care to adult care during adolescence. This situation has brought up transitional care, which is defined as ""the purposeful and planned movement of adolescents and young adults with chronic physical and medical conditions from pediatric to adult-oriented health systems"". Since adolescents with congenital heart disease are at high risk for complications in adulthood, it is very important to raise awareness, increase the level of readiness for adult care and gain self-management skills during the transition phase. This study was planned as a randomized controlled experimental study to evaluate the effect of the developmental transition care model applied to adolescents with congenital heart disease during the transition from pediatric care to adult care on the transition readiness level, self-management skills and care satisfaction of adolescents.

Studies have shown that both adolescents with congenital heart disease and their caregivers need professional support, appropriate transition education and care before transition to adult care in order to increase adaptation to adult care, to gain self-management skills and to reduce their concerns.

With a rising cases of complex CHD and patients with pulmonary valve regurgitation in TOF repair, a further demand is underway for valved conduits. Meanwhile, common biological valved conduits applied in foreign countries are not approved in China yet, with high failure and reintervention, reducing the long-term survival. Our team manufactured a novel valved conduit with 0.1mm expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and gore-tex conduit. This ePTFE valved conduit played a satisfying role in anti-regurgitation and failure rate through in vitro fluid test and animal experiments. Besides, our team manufactured templates for the conduit and also simplified the suturing process so that the repeatability of suturing valved had been risen. Until now, over 70 cases have been implanted with this ePTFE valved conduit with positive early and mid-term follow-up results.

Despite the progress which have been made, there still remain some problems to solve. First, systematic prospective randomized comparative study will be performed. Second, this is just a single-center study. Third, these patients should have longer follow-up time to evaluate the ePTFE conduit long-term effect. Finally, imaging data are blank for evaluating the function of the conduit and right ventricle. In this prospective comparative research, the new designed ePTFE valved conduit and bovine jugular vein valved conduits are conducted as a randomized controlled trail. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is used to precisely evaluate the anti-regurgitation effect of the valved conduit and the right ventricle function.

The presence of a mild to moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) results in a significantly reduced long-term survival and increased hospitalizations for heart-failure. The benefit of adding mitral valve surgery to coronary artery by-pass surgery (CABG) is well documented in the combination of coronary artery disease and severe MR. On the other hand, it is clinical practice to refrain from repairing the mitral valve in those CABG cases where the IMR is mild to moderate. However, there are no conclusive data available to support this principle. The existing studies are small, retrospective, and the results contradictive. The need for a prospective randomized trial has frequently been proposed and discussed, however, to the best of our knowledge, such a study has not yet commenced.

Study design:

The Moderate Mitral Regurgitation In Patients Undergoing CABG (MoMIC) Trial is the first international multi-center, large-scale study to clarify whether moderate IMR in CABG patients should be corrected. A total of 550 CABG patients with moderate IMR are to be randomized to either CABG alone or CABG plus mitral valve correction.
