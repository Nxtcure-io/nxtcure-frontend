Keyhole gallbladder surgery is typically performed under general anaesthesia (or while the patient is 'fully asleep'), however doctors use other pain relief types to reduce pain after the operation. One of these options is local anaesthetic, which involves the injection of an medication into or onto the part of the body which has been operated on. The reason for doing this is to reduce the pain felt by the patient in the part if the body where the operation occurred. The best way of using these medications remain unclear.

The local anaesthetic being used in the study is fully approved for use in Ireland and the drug itself is not being tested. In other words, the drug is not an experimental drug. Local anaesthetic drugs are given in different ways in patients who have just had the keyhole surgery on their gall bladder (this is the surgery that you are about to have).

Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare two ways of giving patients these local anaesthetic medications following key-hole gallbladder surgery. These include (1) injecting the medication into the skin at the surgical wounds and squirting it onto the liver (where the gallbladder has been removed from), or (2) injecting the medication into the skin at the surgical wounds and into the muscles in the abdomen (known formally as a transversus abdominus plane block).",144,* Adult patients aged 18 years or older will be considered for recruitment into this study if they are indicated to undergo elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy,N/A,False,ALL,18 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,N/A,"Matthew G Davey, MB BCh BAO MuCh MRCSI PhD",CONTACT,+353180320000,matthewdavey21@rcsi.ie,"Royal College of Surgeons, Ireland",N/A

There is however a controversy about which fractures that need surgery and randomised trials have not been able to show a clinically important advantage in patient reported outcome measures for those operated. The trend is therefore that also displaced and comminute fractures are treated non-operatively. There is however very little scientific support for how the non-operative treatment should be designed and performed.

It is known that children who received painful medical procedures can develop a higher sensitivity of pain during their following experiences.

During their treatments for malignant diseases, children are exposed to a lot of painful procedures (eg. needle insertion, lumbar punction, myelogram, etc...)

Therefore, medical societies propose the use of interventions like distraction techniques for pain management in complement of pharmacological treatment.

In addition, the repetitions of painful procedures and ineffective prevention of pain can create care phobia.

Within this context, immersive and participative virtual reality (VR) could be an innovative distraction technique for pain management among children undergoing medical procedures.

Attention Pain Theory can explain how virtual reality can reduce the perception of pain. Attention is required to feel pain. When the patient is focused on another subject like an immersive virtual environment, his brain is less available to treat information like painful stimulus from care procedures.

The investigators hypothesis is that VR can reduce procedural-related pain and can decrease fear during the following procedures.

Results of previous studies are varied : some showed a non-significant reduction of patient's procedural pain despite the use of VR, whereas others concluded to a decrease of pain. The question of the benefit of VR for the patients who are exposed to repeated painful procedures remains still unclear, especially with patients who are likely to feel chronic pain or many pain-related exposures.

Matching the patient's respiratory needs with adequate ventilator settings is necessary to ensure a low work of breathing (WOB) and maximal patient comfort. The inspiratory rise time (IRT) determines the time to reach the selected airway pressure. A short IRT results in a high peak inspiratory flow and a short time to reach that peak, but is also associated with the development of turbulent flow, resulting in increased WOB. Aim of this study is to investigate the effects of different IRT settings on WOB and patient comfort during pressure support ventilation.

Methods We will performed a prospective, single blind cohort study in patients on Pressure Support Ventilation. 10 healthy adult patients admitted to the ICU after elective facial or neck surgery will be included. All patients will be ventilated in pressure support mode using a Servo 300 ventilator (Siemens. Elema, Solna, Sweden), with a positive end expiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O, pressure support level of 12 cm H2O above PEEP and an inspiratory oxygen fraction of 0.40. Patients have to be awake and cooperative (Ramsay 2). WOB will be measured with an esophageal balloon, and miniature flowmeter (Bicore system).

Currently, hepatic resection is often the only curative treatment for primary or secondary hepatic malignancies and is also frequently performed in patients with benign liver tumors to prevent malignant transformation and/or alleviate symptoms. Liver resections are nowadays associated with low mortality and acceptable morbidity. As result of that, an increasing number of patients is currently under consideration for resection of more complex or large tumors, thus requiring extensive resection procedures. Application of vascular exclusion (i.e., clamping of the portal vein and hepatic artery) during such procedures reduces blood loss, which is one of the most important factors affecting peri-operative outcomes. However, vascular exclusion leads to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury as an inevitable side-effect, which adversely impacts postoperative liver function and regeneration. Additional cooling of the liver by means of hypothermic perfusion is expected to further reduce intraoperative blood loss, as well as to protect the liver from I/R injury. Therefore, the aim of this pilot study is to cool the future remnant liver (FRL) in situ during right hemihepatectomy under vascular exclusion. Consequently, an overall improvement in postoperative outcomes is expected due to a decrease in intraoperative blood loss, reduced parenchymal damage, and a better ability of the liver remnant to regenerate.

Objective

To reduce intraoperative blood loss and enhance tolerance of the FRL to I/R injury during right hemihepatectomy under vascular exclusion by means of in situ hypothermic perfusion with retrograde outflow (R-IHP) of the FRL.

Study design

The study is designed as a prospective randomized pilot study in 18 patients (9 interventions and 9 controls) to assess the effects of the proposed intervention. Additionally, 4 patients will be included separately for assessment of the intervention's feasibility prior to randomized inclusion.

Study population

Eligible patients for participation in this study are those planned to undergo right hemihepatectomy under vascular inflow occlusion because of a malignant or benign liver tumor, and who do not suffer from any hepatic co-morbidity that might influence postoperative outcomes (i.e., severe steatosis, cholestasis, cirrhosis, or hepatitis B/C infection).

Intervention

During right hemihepatectomy, the FRL of patients allocated to the intervention group will be perfused with a chilled perfusion solution (i.e., lactated Ringer's solution).",22,"* Patients scheduled for right hemihepatectomy under vascular inflow occlusion for a malignant or benign hepatic tumor * Age \< 18 years * BMI \> 35 kg/m2 * ASA classification IV/V * Patient is scheduled for a combined surgical procedure (e.g., bile duct resection, gastrointestinal procedures) * Patient underwent liver resection ≤ 1 year prior to scheduled surgery * Emergency operations * Pregnancy or breast feeding","* Cirrhosis, * Severe steatosis (≥ 30%), * Cholestasis, and * Hepatitis B/C infection * Age ≥ 18 years * Signed informed consent obtained prior to any study-specific procedure * ASA classification I-III",False,ALL,18 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,Netherlands,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Academisch Medisch Centrum - Universiteit van Amsterdam (AMC-UvA),OTHER

Affective Disorders (ADs) are the most common mental health conditions in the US, and over 40% of people with ADs are current smokers. A national policy of reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes has the potential to reduce tobacco use, dependence, and related adverse health outcomes. Controlled trials in psychiatrically-stable smokers have shown that reducing the nicotine content in cigarettes can reduce cigarettes per day (CPD), dependence and tobacco toxicant exposure, with few adverse consequences.

The goal of the proposed trial is to experimentally model whether increasing the availability and appeal of an alternative, non-combusted source of nicotine (e-cigarettes) moderates the effect of altering the nicotine in cigarettes in smokers with ADs. Additionally, investigators will test whether allowing participants to personalize the flavor of the e-liquid alters any moderating effects their availability may have on tobacco cigarette smoking.

Daily smokers with current ADs will be recruited at Brown University and the University of Vermont.

Investigators will study two research cigarettes referred to here as Research Cigarette 1 (RC1) and Research Cigarette 2 (RC2). One of these cigarettes will be a normal nicotine content cigarette and the other will be a reduced nicotine content cigarette. Investigators will study two e-cigarette conditions referred to here as E-Cigarette Condition 1 (EC1) and E-Cigarette Condition 2 (EC2). Both e-cigarette conditions will involve the same commercially available devices and same nicotine-containing e-liquid, but in one condition that e-liquid will be available only in tobacco flavor while in the other condition that e-liquid will be available in multiple flavors from which participants can choose based on personal taste preference. Participants will be assigned to one of the following four study conditions: (1) RC1 only; (2) RC2 only; (3) RC2 + EC1; (4) RC2 + EC2.

Participants will be asked to use only their assigned study products for 16 weeks. Outcome measures include total CPD, cigarette demand assessed by behavioral economics-based purchase tasks, craving, withdrawal, psychiatric symptoms, breath carbon monoxide (CO), biomarkers of tobacco toxicant exposure, brain function and structure, and airway inflammation (fractional nitric oxide concentration in exhaled breath \[FeNO\]).",326,* Between 21 years and 70 years old * Must have current diagnosis of an Affective Disorder.,* Being without an Affective Disorder * Younger than 21 years old * Older than 70 years old,True,ALL,18 Years,70 Years,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Brown University,OTHER

One of the most common negative consequences of aging is the decline in muscle mass, strength and power. This is most notable in lower limb muscles. These muscles are required for the performance of daily activities including walking, stair climbing and standing up from sitting. Regular exercise is considered one of the most effective measures to slow, and even reverse the progression of muscle weakness. Nevertheless older adults may notice a decline in their capability to undertake regular exercises, this may be due to a decline in their muscle's ability to buffer pH. Carnosine (made by bonding β-alanine and histidine) has been suggested to contribute to the extension of physical performance, counteracting the decline the muscle's ability to buffer pH. Yet this pH buffering process it largely restricted by the amount of β-alanine available in the human body. β-alanine is already known to decline in older individuals due to a reduction in food products (meat, fish and poultry). Yet through either consumption of β-alanine rich food, or through short-term supplementation, β-alanine is raised, increasing carnosine concentrations. Improved β-alanine levels can potentially advance exercise performance, for example significant improvements in time to exhaustion on both a constant (37%) and incremental (12%) treadmill tests have been demonstrated. It is therefore proposed that via β-alanine supplementation, an individual's perception of their frailty, maintenance of health and independent living can be improved in older individuals.

However, these findings are based on participants, both young and older, who are well-rested with no prior exercise or fatigue to the assessed muscles. It remains unclear if β-alanine supplementation will aid in the buffering of pH when the muscle has already been fatigued. Therefore this investigation hopes to examine the effects of 4 week β-alanine supplementation on lower limb contractile and force properties, pre and post muscle specific fatigue.",24,"* All participants will be defined as 'medically stable' for exercise studies, as proposed by Grieg et al.

Gene therapy is a relatively new field of medicine that uses genetic material (mostly DNA) from the patient to treat his or her own disease. In gene therapy, the investigators introduce new genetic material in order to fix or replace a diseased gene, with the goal of curing the disease. The procedure is similar to a bone marrow transplant, in that the patient's malfunctioning blood stem cells are reduced or eliminated using chemotherapy, but it is different because instead of using a different person's (donor) blood stem cells for the transplant, the patient's own blood stem cells are given back after the new genetic material has been introduced into those cells. This approach has the advantage of eliminating any risk of Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD), reducing the risk of graft rejection, and may also allow less chemotherapy to be utilized for the conditioning portion of the transplant procedure. The method used to fix or replace a diseased gene is called gene editing. A person's own cells are edited using a specialized biological medicine that has been formulated for use in human beings.

Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is a healthy, non-sickling kind of hemoglobin. Investigators have recently discovered a gene called BCL11A that is very important in the control of fetal hemoglobin expression.

This can result in feeding intolerance, which is expressed by abdominal distension, regurgitation or vomiting, irregular transit and abdominal discomfort. This feeding intolerance influences the length of hospitalization and can lead to necrotising enterocolitis, a major complication.

In the Neonatal Intensive Care Units of Clermont-Ferrand hospital center, abdominal massages have been performed by physiotherapists for several years in order to improve the condition of the digestive system. However, the indication for abdominal massage is very dependent on the caregivers in charge of the newborn and the evaluation of the abdominal condition remains subjective with a great variability between examiners. Thus, some newborns will receive massage multiple times a day while others will not.

Developmental care is essential for these premature infants, especially to avoid over-stimulation. It is important not to add care, such as massage, if it is not needed. It is therefore essential to properly assess the digestive status of premature babies in order to determine whether they have feeding intolerance and whether they require treatment with abdominal massage.

A non-union is a lack of bone healing (bone growth where the break in the bone occurred) after 3 months after the operation. The diaphyseal is an area of a specific bone (usually near the middle) where the fracture occurred. The bones we are interested in are the clavicle (collar bone), tibia (lower leg), femur (upper leg), humerus (upper arm) and forearm (lower arm). Treatment goals for these types of fractures are to minimize later surgeries, to assist the healing process, and to decrease the time to healing. The ability of a patient with non-union (lack of bone healing after 3 months post operation) to return to the work force and to normal activities more quickly not only has a good financial impact on society (community), but also improves over-all physical and mental well-being of the patients.

""Infuse"" is a synthetic bone morphogenic protein which means it has the ability to help your bone to form and heal if inserted in the fracture site. ""Infuse"" may be the first commercially available product approved by Health Canada to accelerate the healing of long bone non-unions requiring surgical intervention.

Although the safety and efficacy of Infuse has been demonstrated through numerous pre-clinical studies, further human clinical trial is needed to evaluate the safety and the power to produce effects of this product particularly with respect to non unions of long bones. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the power to produce effects of Infuse implanted during treatment of long bone non unions to reduce later surgeries required to augment the healing process and to accelerate the time to healing.

Despite the immense needs, there is a severe lack of culturally appropriate, evidence-based interventions to support the resilience and well-being of these vulnerable populations.

To fill this gap, the study will evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of a novel life skills education (LSE) program delivered through two innovative approaches: in-person peer support groups and WhatsApp-based virtual support groups. The LSE curriculum, developed through extensive community engagement, covers topics such as stress management, communication, problem-solving, health, safety, and advocacy, all tailored to the unique challenges of displacement.

In the in-person arm, trained IDP peers and local providers will facilitate weekly group sessions over 12 weeks, providing a safe space for participants to learn, practice, and apply new skills while building social connections and support networks. In the WhatsApp arm, participants will receive weekly messages with educational content, reflection prompts, and exercises, moderated by trained facilitators to foster dialogue and peer support.

By comparing these two delivery methods, the study aims to identify the most feasible, acceptable, and effective strategies for rolling out psychosocial support interventions in humanitarian settings, particularly those with limited resources and access. The study will also assess the interventions' impact on key mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, and well-being, as well as life skills, functioning, and implementation metrics such as reach, adoption, and sustainability.

NCT03444779,"Comparative Evaluation of Minimally Invasive ""tibial Tuberoplasty"" Surgical Technique Versus Conventional Open Surgery for Tibial Plateau Fractures","Comparative Evaluation of Minimally Invasive ""tibial Tuberoplasty"" Surgical Technique Versus Conventional Open Surgery for Tibial Plateau Fractures (TUBERIMPACT Study)",COMPLETED,2018-10-26,2024-11-14,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,Schatzker Type 2 or 3 Tibial Plateau Fracture,Tibial Tuberoplasty; Open technique,Post-operative radiological step-off reduction blindly measured by high resolution CT-scan,"PMSI (French Medico-Administrative Database) data shows more than 10000 proximal tibial fractures diagnosed in 2014 and 4055 lateral tibial plateau fractures operated in 2013 in France. 50% of these surgical fractures is related to the lateral condyle and causes split/depression (Schatzker 2) or pure depression (Schatzker 3). This high rate results from the recent democratization of high-risk sports, as well as an aging population with increased risks of falling. Aside from the resulting reduced physical activity, the social and professional impact of these fractures is undeniable and represents significant costs for our health care system. A recently published prospective case series reports 28 job losses out of 41 patients treated.

The clinical outcome of these patients depends mainly on the primary stability provided by the surgical treatment, after the greatest anatomical reduction possible. Indeed, Giannoudis and al. have demonstrated that under simple X-rays, the smaller the detected step-off, the better the outcome.The aim is to allow for recovery of good joint mobility to promote rapid resumption of activity and to limit the onset of early osteoarthritis.

The classical technique used for reduction and osteosynthesis of tibial plateau fractures (open surgical technique using a bone tamp) has several pitfalls : devascularization of the bone and skin, risks of infection and functional rehabilitation difficulties with delayed recovery of weight bearing. Moreover, this technique does not allow for the simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of other possible lesions, such as meniscal injuries in particular.

Since 2011, Poitiers University Hospital is offering to its patients a new minimally invasive technique for the reduction and stabilization of tibial plateau fractures, baptized ""Tibial Tuberoplasty"". The concept derives from the divergent use of vertebral kyphoplasty, initially dedicated for spinal injuries and transposed here to the tibial plateau. This technique involves expansion of the tibial plateau through inflation of a kyphoplasty balloon, filling of the created cavity with cement (PMMA, calcium phosphate) and percutaneous screw fixation.

Orthopaedic surgeons of Poitiers University Hospital performed the first tibial tuberoplasties through a feasibility study on 36 cadaveric subjects and then transposed the technique to human. Surgeons identified major advantages such as minimal skin damage, possible treatment of posterior and multi-fragmented compressions (lifting in a single block by the balloon), reinforcement of the stability of the assembly using cement, possible use of combined arthroscopy (for concomitant meniscal injuries treatment).

This technique allows for optimization of the fracture reduction by elevating the posterior fragments with the inflatable bone tamp through an anterior approach. The reduction is made possible thanks to the specificity of the inflatable bone tamp which inflates and reduces the area of least resistance.

The aim of this innovative technique is focused on the anatomical reduction in order to restore the convexity of the tibial plateau which is similar to the balloon convexity.

The results from the first 40 patients operated since 2011 are promising and show a proportion of 70% presenting less than 5 mm step-off reduction. A larger scale multicenter randomized controlled trial is now requested to further demonstrate the superiority of the ""Tibial Tuberoplasty"" to the standard treatment.

The coordinator investigator designed this study to evaluate the quality of tibial fracture reduction offered by percutaneous ""Tibial Tuberoplasty"" versus conventional open surgery for tibial plateau fracture but also its impact on clinical outcome.",137,N/A,N/A,False,ALL,18 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,Martinique; France,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Poitiers University Hospital,OTHER

This platform leverages eye-tracking technology to assess and potentially enhance cognitive functions, particularly attention and memory.

The diagnostic component of the study investigates the use of eye vergence responses-elicited during a visual attention task-as potential biomarkers for early AD. Specifically, the study will re-validate eye vergence by comparing response patterns among three groups: cognitively healthy older adults, individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and patients with confirmed AD, based on blood biomarkers (ßA40, ßA42, pTau181, and pTau217). The diagnostic task follows an oddball paradigm, where participants must detect target images (grapes) among distractors (other fruits) across 100 one-second trials, lasting approximately three minutes. Eye vergence is recorded using remote infrared eye-tracking, while participants simply fixate on a computer screen.

The therapeutic aspect evaluates the impact of BGaze Therapy, which employs ""serious games"" designed to train attentional control through eye movements. The game dynamically adjusts its difficulty in real time and provides continuous feedback to enhance user engagement and learning efficacy.

Veteran suicide rates exceed those of the general population, with the disorder creating a mental health challenge that is costly and debilitating. The majority of Veterans with PTSD also have comorbid mental health diagnoses, such as generalized anxiety disorder, substance abuse disorder, and major depression. The treatment of Veteran PTSD and comorbid disorders represents an important therapeutic and rehabilitation problem. The disorder is complex and difficult to treat, with high treatment dropout and nonresponse rates spurring some Veterans to seek complementary integrative health strategies. One promising complementary strategy is the provision of a trained service dog. Initial evidence across multiple research groups highlights service dogs as a promising complement to evidence-based practices that can offer short-term improvements. However, the long-term effectiveness, mechanisms of action, and moderators of efficacy remain largely unknown. Thus, the overarching objective of this proposal is to understand how, why, and for whom PTSD service dogs are most effective.

To address this objective, the present project will assess the longitudinal efficacy and dose-response curve of service dogs for Veteran PTSD symptomology and psychosocial functioning. The research design will consist of a two-arm, randomized clinical trial (RCT) with longitudinal assessments over a period of 15 months. Results are expected to elucidate the clinical impact of service dogs for military Veterans with PTSD, as well as the biobehavioral mechanisms of action and characteristics that moderate efficacy.

The study sponsor will not be involved in how participants are treated with VPRIV, will provide instructions on how the clinic will record what happens during the study.

VPRIV is a type of enzyme replacement therapy (also known as ERT).

During this time, medical data will be collected from the participants' medical records.

During the study, participants will be treated with VPRIV according to their clinic's standard practice. VPRIV is given by a slow injection into the vein, also known as an infusion. This will happen in the clinic or at home.

The standard treatment for endometrial cancer is total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, peritoneal cytology, and lymph node dissection. However, young patients who desire to preserve their potential for fertility may find this standard treatment difficult to accept. Therefore, the conservative treatment for these patients has remained a challenge. A number of studies have reported the effectiveness of hormonal therapy using systemic progestin in women clinically diagnosed with early endometrial adenocarcinoma at stage IA, grade 1, who want to maintain reproductive potential. In addition, several recent studies reported the use of LNG-IUS to treat patients at a high risk of perioperative complications who cannot tolerate systemic progesterone because of its adverse effects. Nevertheless, there has been no prospective multicenter trial that investigated the effectiveness of treatment with systemic progesterone in combination with intrauterine progesterone in young women with endometrial cancer.

Therefore, the investigators conducted a prospective trial of the treatment of the presumably early-stage grade 1 endometrial cancer in young women who desire to preserve fertility by using oral MPA in combination with LNG-IUS.

Young patients with histologically confirmed grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma that is presumably confined to the endometrium, who desired to preserve fertility potential go through LNG-IUS insertion and are administered MPA at a dosage of 500 mg/d concurrently. Follow-up and treatment response assessment were implemented at a 3-month interval with office endometrial aspiration biopsy with LNG-IUS in place and dilatation and curettage after removal of LNG-IUS.

it is important to get the CRT pacemaker checked to make sure that it is working correctly and performing its job. However, it can be difficult to adjust the settings of the pacemaker just the right amount to ensure the heart is pumping efficiently.

One of the ways this can be done is by using a special machine which uses ultrasound to make a 2-dimensional image of the heart called an echocardiogram. This technique can also be used to measure the flow of blood in the heart and calculate how efficient it is at pumping blood. However adjusting the settings of the pacemaker with this device is difficult to use and time consuming.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) a 2-dimensional electrical tracing of the hearts activity is another tool used to help adjust the settings of pacemakers, to make the heart pump more efficiently. Furthermore, recent research has shown that this is better than echocardiogram at optimising pacemaker device settings.

A new type of ECG called cardiogoniometry (CGM) has recently been developed which creates a 3-dimensional view of the hearts electrical activity and has already been shown to be better than normal ECG at diagnosing certain conditions like angina and heart attacks. However it has never been used to try optimise the settings of the pacemakers used in CRT and may be quicker and easier to use than then other methods available. More importantly it is hoped by doing this it will reduce the symptoms that patients suffer as it is making the heart pump more efficiently.

As it has been untested and never used in this setting before, and there it is necessary to find out if the CGM machine will recognise when the settings on the pacemaker are changed.

NCT03672279,Validation of a Novel Self-Administered Cognitive Assessment Tool (CogCheck) in Patients With Mild and Major Neurocognitive Disorder Predominantly Due to Alzheimer's Disease,Validation of a Novel Self-Administered Cognitive Assessment Tool (CogCheck) in Patients With Mild and Major Neurocognitive Disorder Predominantly Due to Alzheimer's Disease,RECRUITING,2021-07-27,2024-12-31,OBSERVATIONAL,N/A,Dementia Alzheimers; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Cognition Disorders; Neurocognitive Disorders,CogCheck,CogCheck,"Due to the demographical development, age-related diseases will drastically increase over the next decades. To face this healthcare challenge, early and accurate identification of cognitive impairment is crucial. The assessment of neurocognitive functioning ideally requires a tool that is short, easy to administer and interpret, and has high diagnostic accuracy. In this context, the use of computerized test batteries is receiving increasing attention. Compared to paper-pencil tests, computerized test batteries have many advantages. The possibility to measure reaction times may provide additional information. Moreover, test questions are always presented the exact same way, examiner-related bias is eliminated, and results are available immediately after examination. Due to the ability to adjust the level of difficulty to the performance of the individual, floor and ceiling effects may be minimized. Additionally, costs are reduced, and fewer materials and less trained personnel are required. Finally, big data approaches and the use of machine learning algorithms are becoming more popular in the field of clinical diagnostics, and computerized cognitive test batteries may facilitate future data collection to this aim.

In 2014, we developed a self-administered tablet computer program for the iPad (CogCheck) to assess preoperative cognitive functioning in surgery patients.

The cognitive tests used in the CogCheck application are identical or similar to the paper-and-pencil tests that are currently used in dementia diagnostics. Replacing some of the paper-and-pencil tests by a computerized test battery may facilitate the routine neuropsychological examinations. Thus, we aim to investigate the diagnostic accuracy and user-friendliness of CogCheck when applied in a cognitively impaired patient sample. In a first step, the diagnostic properties of CogCheck will be examined by differentiating between healthy controls and patients with mild or major neurocognitive disorder (NCD) predominantly due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Data from healthy controls have been collected (EKNZ Req-2016-00393) in a previous normative study of CogCheck. Thus a further aim is to investigate the user-friendliness of CogCheck in patients with mild or major NCD predominantly due to AD.

The primary aim of our study is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of CogCheck for patients with mild or major NCD predominantly due to AD in a German-speaking population.

Secondary aims are: (1) to examine the user-friendliness of CogCheck in patients with mild or major NCD predominantly due to AD, (2) to compare the results between cognitively healthy individuals (EKNZ Req-2016-00393) and patients with mild or major NCD predominantly due to AD on each of the CogCheck subtest, (3) to establish an algorithm with the CogCheck subtests that optimally distinguishes between cognitively healthy controls (EKNZ Req-2016-00393) and patients with mild or major NCD predominantly due to AD, (4) to compare the diagnostic properties of CogCheck with the ones of the currently used paper-pencil tests.",100,N/A,N/A,False,ALL,65 Years,N/A,OLDER_ADULT,Switzerland,"Andreas U Monsch, PhD",CONTACT,+41 61 326 47 70,andreas.monsch@felixplatter.ch,"University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland",N/A

For people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), this is caused by problems such as high blood pressure and diabetes. NVAF happens more often in elderly people and can lead to stroke, heart failure, and death. Doctors are currently able to give patients a type of treatment called an anticoagulant. Anticoagulants work by making the blood thinner. They are thought to help reduce the risk of stroke and death caused by NVAF. In this study, researchers wanted to learn more about what elderly people think of taking anticoagulants that do not have any vitamin K in them. These are called non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs).

This study will include up to about 150 Belgian men and women aged 75 years and over who have NVAF and have been treated with NOACs. The study will also include about 10 doctors who have treated these patients.

In this study, there will be no required tests or visits. Instead, patients will answer a paper questionnaire about their use of NOACs. The researchers will ask the doctors questions about how they treat their patients using NOACs. The main types of questions the researchers will focus on are:

* The patient characteristics of the elderly with NVAF who are treated with NOACs
* The level of fear of the elderly about bleeding while using a blood thinner and the fear of stroke/thrombosis.
* The geriatrician's thoughts about using NOACs to treat NVAF in elderly patients
* Those patient characteristics geriatrician's find most important when deciding on the anticoagulation treatment in the elderly patients.

NCT02097979,The Impact of a Brief Educational Intervention on Glaucoma Adherence,The Impact of a Brief Educational Intervention on Glaucoma Adherence,COMPLETED,2007-07,2013-06,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,Glaucoma Medication Adherence,Glaucoma Educational Intervention,Medication Possession Ratio,"OBJECTIVE Our objective was to determine whether two group educational sessions plus one-on-one eye drop instillation training would improve adherence to glaucoma therapy as measured by pharmacy claims data in a cohort of newly diagnosed patients. Our hypothesis was that adherence would be improved in the intervention group and that patients would better understand their disease and how to manage it.

METHODS Study Design and Population: A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in newly diagnosed glaucoma patients at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital in Montreal, Canada. Half of the participants were randomized to receive the intervention and half were randomized to receive a delayed intervention at the conclusion of the study. Inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of glaucoma requiring intraocular pressure lowering eye drop therapy and prescription drug insurance through the Régie de l'Assurance Maladie du Québec (RAMQ) (the Quebec Health Insurance Program) throughout the course of the study. There were three sources of data for this study: a questionnaire, the medical record, and RAMQ prescription drug claims data. Follow-up was for one year.

Recruitment and Randomization: From July, 2007 until December, 2011, a researcher approached eligible patients to determine their interest in participating in the study. Interested participants signed the informed consent form and were randomized. Participants in the intervention group were given an appointment to come back to the Hospital for the group intervention. Participants in the control group were given an appointment to receive the group intervention at the end of the study.

Intervention: Small groups of about 10 people were gathered for two 60-90 minute educational sessions on glaucoma in a classroom at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital. During a break, each patient received one-on-one teaching on how to properly instill drops without touching the eye or using unnecessary drops.

Questionnaire and Assessment of Eye Drop Technique: A single questionnaire was given at the end of the study to all participants. The intervention group completed the questionnaire after the intervention while the control group completed the questionnaire before the intervention. Questions were included on demographics, systemic comorbidities, ocular medications, eye drop practices and difficulties, and glaucoma knowledge.

The instructor rated the ability of the participant to put eye drops in the eye taking into account the number of drops that were used and whether contact with the lid or conjunctiva occurred (good, fair, bad).

We created a composite score on the perception of the importance of glaucoma eye drop therapy using the following four questions: 1) do you think glaucoma is a serious disease, 2) do you believe that your treatment will be effective, 3) do you think your drops can lower the pressure in your eyes, 4) do you think your drops can help to preserve vision. Answers of no or do not know were given 0 points and answers of yes were given 1 point. Scores were summed and the composite score ranged from 0 to 4.

Medical Chart Review: At the end of the follow-up period, information was obtained on: the prescribed eye drop therapy for each patient per eye, whether the patient had undergone glaucoma filtering surgery, whether the patient had died or was no longer being followed, the most recent visual field mean deviation in the better eye using the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer 24-2 SITA Standard Program.

Pharmaceutical Claims and Calculation of Medication Possession Ratio: The Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) was calculated as the sum of days of prescription supply divided by the number of days in which a prescription was required. Each person gave consent to contact the RAMQ to obtain pharmaceutical claims for all glaucoma medications. Data were collected on the date of purchase, and the name, dose, and class of the medicine. Data on the number of days of medication available per bottle were taken from the Rylander and Friedman studies with the minimum value used. For the numerator of the MPR, we calculated how many days of medication were available using RAMQ data. For the denominator of the MPR, we calculated the number of days that medication was prescribed in the medical chart. We took into account whether drops were needed for one or two eyes. If a participant was on multiple medications, we calculated a single mean MPR for all medications. We then dichotomized the MPR so that those having medication less than 75% of the days were defined as non-adherent, as we did previously in Djafari et al.

SIGNIFICANCE Adherence can be a problem in glaucoma because patients must often take daily eye drops despite not noticing any benefit to their vision and despite frequent side effects. Low cost interventions that help to improve adherence are needed.",N/A,-,-,N/A,ALL,18 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,Canada,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital,OTHER

However the data are contradicting in respect to the direction of this association and therefore the net effect of UPS activity on the cardiovascular system is not known. Inhibitors of UPS are currently standard of care for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Heart failure and hypertension have been reported in studies of carfilzomib, an irreversible 2nd generation proteasome inhibitor, both as a single agent and in combination with other drugs but their potential vascular toxicity is not adequately studied. Furthermore, as the role of the UPS has not been studied yet clinically but only in experimental and autopsy based studies, assessment of UPS inhibition in humans would facilitate understanding of the UPS-mediated pathophysiologic mechanisms in human atherosclerosis. Thus, this project may stimulate further research on the role of UPS in atherogenesis and potential new therapeutic approaches on vascular dysfunction may arise. We designed the following project in order to investigate the acute and chronic effect of Carfilzomib (CFZ) on cardiovascular function. Patients with an indication to receive CFZ will be recruited to be followed in the Clinical Therapeutics Department in pre-specified timepoints. Functional and structural measurements including markers of arterial stiffness and subclinical atherosclerosis will be performed using non-invasive well-validated techniques. Blood pressure will be also evaluated using 24h hour ambulatory monitoring. Evaluation of cardiac function will be performed at baseline and thereafter at 6 months or earlier if a suspicious event occurs necessitating evaluation of cardiac function.

OSA is a well established risk factor for systemic hypertension myocardial infarction or stroke and it has been documented that blood pressure rises in a very consistent fashion during apneic episodes. The incidence of the episodes of apnea during sleep causes repeated subclinical acute kidney injuries (AKI) contributing to the development of CKD.

III. Background Sports drinks are designed to provide CHO, electrolytes, and fluids to the body, which are absorbed very fast from the small intestine. In other words, the period from ingestion until the CHO, electrolytes, and fluids reach the muscles, brain and so on, should be very short. This is the most important advantage of using sports drinks (Simulescu, Ilia, Macarie, \& Merghes, 2019).

This research study is a way of gaining new knowledge about the treatment of patients with cGVHD. This research study is evaluating a drug called abatacept.

Abatacept is a drug that alters and suppresses the immune system. Abatacept is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adults and of severe juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in patients who have failed prior therapy with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These are autoimmune conditions, ie caused by an overactive immune system that attacks normal tissues and organs. It is currently being tested in a variety of other autoimmune conditions. In this case it is considered experimental.

cGVHD is caused by the donor cells attacking various organs of the recipient. The investigators try to minimize this immune attack by using corticosteroids such as prednisone. In severe cases prednisone is not sufficient and other immunosuppressive medications are used in addition in order to more efficiently control cGVHD and to limit the dose and consequently the multiple side-effects of corticosteroids. This study is being done to determine if the use of abatacept is safe in patients with cGVHD and if it can facilitate a better control of cGVHD.

During this study the participants will be evaluated for side effects from the treatment with abatacept, and for response of the cGVHD to the treatment. There will be two groups of participants in the study. The first group will be treated at a relatively low dose of abatacept.

Many instruments have been developed to identify fragility at the individual level. The 'Fragile' phenotype defined by Fried is based on 5 criteria: weakness, slowness, low level of activity, exhaustion, and unintentional weight loss. The patient is fragile if it meets at least three out of five criteria. It is 'pre-fragile' if it meets one or two criteria.

In onco-geriatrics, the International onco-geriatrics society recommends the implementation of a 'G8 scale' to detect elderly patients at risk of fragility. People with a positive G8 are then referred to the geriatric team to benefit from a comprehensive geriatric assessment. This evaluation is interpreted by the geriatrician, who proposes an action plan to overcome the various problems of the elderly patient. The evaluation can also help the oncologist in the choice of treatment for the patient: palliative care, standard treatment or adapted treatment (No-go, Go-go or slow-go).

The investigators would like to assess if fragility as defined by the Fried criteria is predictive of a functional, physical or cognitive decline, or a loss of quality of life in patients treated for a solid malignant tumor.

Furthermore, they will assess if the frailness categorization has an impact on the oncologic treatment decision.

* Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is a low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
* LGL is associated with low numbers of white blood cells (leading to recurring infections), red blood cells (causing anemia) and platelets (causing abnormal bleeding).
* Cyclosporine (CSA) is an immunosuppressive drug that improves low blood cell counts in about 50 percent of patients with LGL leukemia.

Objectives:

* To identify what factors determine why cyclosporine works in some patients and not in others.
* To identify what causes low blood counts in LGL leukemia.

Eligibility: Patients 18 years of age and older with LGL leukemia.

Design:

* Patients have a medical history, physical examination blood tests, bone marrow biopsy and x-ray studies, including chest x-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Patients with an easily accessible enlarged lymph node have a node biopsy (removal of a small piece of tissue for microscopic examination).
* Patients take cyclosporine twice a day by mouth. Blood samples are taken at least weekly to adjust the cyclosporine dosing to maintain therapeutic serum levels.
* Patients undergo apheresis (collection of white blood cells) at a number of different time points in the study (maximum 6 times) to look at the differences in the leukemia cells before and during treatment with cyclosporine. For apheresis, blood is withdrawn through a needle in an arm vein and directed through a catheter (plastic tube) into a machine that separates it into its components. The white cells are extracted and the rest of the blood is returned through the same needle or through a second needle in the other arm.",5,N/A,N/A,False,ALL,18 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,National Cancer Institute (NCI),NIH

DRA is associated with decreased abdominal strength and degraded health and physical functioning, which results in poorer body perception and satisfaction and negatively affects the quality of life in its multiple spheres (social, sexual and personal). Regarding the different treatment techniques for DRA, different treatments have been described, such as bandages, electrotherapy or therapeutic exercise, the latter being the most scientifically supported option to approach DRA conservatively. Exercise has shown positive effects on DRA severity, abdominal muscle thickness, abdominal strength and endurance, and quality of life in women with DRA.

Another treatment that has shown promising effects in various pathologies is radiofrequency diathermy using the Capacitive-Resistive Electrical Transfer system. The capacitive mode acts on soft tissues containing electrolytes such as muscles and vascular and lymphatic tissues. On the other hand, the resistive mode acts on tissues of higher density and fat and fiber content, such as bones, ligaments and tendons. It has been documented that this type of therapy acts favoring the vascularization of tissues, decreasing inflammation and favoring the processes of cellular repair and analgesia. Its beneficial effect on low back pain and various pelvic floor disorders has been studied. However, at present, there are no studies evaluating the effectiveness of this type of intervention in people with abdominal diastasis.

Although patients typically present this disease as newborns and rarely in later infancy, there have been reports of patients presenting with CCHS in adulthood.

The present study reports a unique familial case in which the father (proband) presented late-onset CCHS with an expansion mutation of the Phox2B gene that was confirmed by genetic analysis. Surprisingly, the proband did not report any manifestation of the disease during childhood, and the disease progressed following an insidious course until adulthood. At the time of diagnosis, he did not present signs of pulmonary hypertension and right-side heart failure. The patient responded well to nocturnal invasive ventilation. In contrast, his son presented CCHS as a newborn with the full complement of symptoms while his daughter did not.

The present report shows that CCHS cases characterized by a mutated Phox2 gene can progress without many symptoms and that the treatment approach used here was efficient for controlling the course of the disease. Furthermore, this case indicates that incomplete penetrance can occur.

Nevertheless, in current post-stroke gait rehabilitation (research) the upper limbs are barely targeted. To address this gap, my project aims to investigate the selective motor control of the upper limbs during walking and the contribution of the cortical activity to the arm swing in independent walkers after stroke.

To gain insight in the direct effects of stroke on the arm swing, the primary motor control of the arm swing will be evaluated by determining muscle synergies (i.e group of muscles working together as a task-specific functional unit). Additionally, the cortical activity (EEG-analysis) during walking of persons post-stroke will be compared to healthy controls and the relationship between stroke-induced changes in cortical activity and arm swing deviations will be assessed. Furthermore, I will evaluate whether improvements in cortical activity relate to improvements in primary motor control of the arm swing.

This innovative project will be the first to investigate the direct coupling between the cortex and the muscle synergies in persons post-stroke during independent walking to investigate the arm swing. These fundamental insights in the primary motor control of the arm swing and the contribution of the cortical activity will allow to develop targeted interventions aiming to improve arm swing and as such optimize post-stroke gait rehabilitation.

Research questions:

1. How can muscle synergies explain arm swing alterations in independent walkers after stroke?
2. How do stroke-induced changes in cortical activity relate to arm swing deviations in persons after stroke?
3.

Prospective Study of Efficacy and Toxicity",COMPLETED,2009-10,2016-09-26,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,Novo Acute Myeloid Leukemia,Mylotarg,Complete Remission of the Disease,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a neoplasm of immature hematopoietic cells (blasts) with altered ripening capacity. Due to excessive proliferation, the blasts displace normal hematopoietic cells and bone marrow failure appears. Leukemic cells also infiltrate extramedullary tissues.

Following the standard chemotherapy treatment, the CR rate achieved is around 65-75% for all patients and 15% lower when considering only patients over 65 years. Modifications to the standard regimen consist of replacing the DNR for a cytotoxic one, modifying the dose of ara-C or adding a third drug.

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg ®) is an immunoconjugate between anti-CD33 antibody and a cytotoxic antitumor antibiotic, calicheamicin. Mylotarg ® antibody specifically binds to CD33, a sialic acid-dependent adhesion protein expressed in over 90% of LMA10. Mylotarg ® selectively transports the cytotoxic agent calicheamicin into leukemic cells and hematopoietic progenitors differentiated from the myelomonocytic line, while respecting the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. Calicheamicin is released only after the fixation of the antibody anti-CD33 and its internalization by the cell, after which binds to and damages the DNA.

Mylotarg ® is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of CD33 positive AML in first relapse, for patients older than 60 years non-candidates for other intensive treatment modalities.

Since the efficacy of Mylotarg ® is equivalent and its toxicity profile less than the conventional therapy, it is logical to conduct a phase II trial exploring the role of Mylotarg ® in the early stages of treatment of AML.

Previous experience with gemtuzumab ozogamicin in relapsed patients led to its use combined with induction chemotherapy. The aim was to improve the CR rate reached with the latter and reduce relapse after achieving greater leukemic cytoreduction.

Recent data from the HOVON group support that the administration of G-CSF before and during induction chemotherapy decreases the incidence of relapse in patients with AML, particularly those considered to have intermediate risk.

Everything mentioned above justifies to investigate the combination of GO combined with chemotherapy with IDR and ara-C in standard 3x7 scheme and analyze the effect of sensitization with G-CSF in patients with AML de novo.

It influences about 2,700 women with about 1,000 women dying of cervical cancer each year and in Taiwan. Human papillomaviruses (HPV) have been consistently implicated in causing cervical cancer especially those high-risk types which have been strongly associated with cervical cancer. In recent years, there has been compelling evidence that infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is a major etiologic factor in the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical carcinoma.

As in most virus-induced diseases, an adequate immune response is likely to play a key role in the clearance of HPV infections and HPV-related lesions. This assumption is born out by both epidemiological studies and animal models. Immune-compromised patients such as HIV-infected women, organ transplant recipients, and patients suffering from other forms of malignancies, are at a higher risk of developing CIN lesions and invasive cervical cancer. Moreover, several studies establish the existence of natural HPV E7-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunity in humans. Only a minority of women infected with oncogenic HPV types develop CIN or cervical cancer. Indeed, the majority of CIN lesions do not progress or even regress to normal cytology, indicating that other factors such as an inadequate immune function are necessary for the development of progressive CIN lesions and cervical carcinoma.

Consequently, the HLA class I and II phenotypes may be correlated with an effective immune response against HPV-associated cervical lesions. Differences in the recognition of foreign antigens, such as those contributed by alleles at the HLA class I or II loci, might be proposed to affect the risk of developing cervical cancer.

In the present proposal, the investigators would like to examine the HLA class I and II associations among Taiwanese women with cervical neoplasia. The purposes of this proposal are:

1. to address the relationships between the HLA class I and II haplotype, HPV infection, and cervical cancer; and
2. to elucidate the immunologic responses to HPV type 16 in different HLA class I and II haplotypes. It will help the investigators to identify which population of HLA genotypes is more susceptible to HPV infection and progresses to invasive cervical cancer. The results of this research will be very useful for the prevention and screening of cervical cancer in the future.",700,"* Using epidemiologic data drawn from a wide range of countries and population groups, investigators have found evidence of HPV in 90% to 95% of cervical cancers. The incidence of HPV in cervical cancer was 79% in our own report. Besides, 91% of high-grade CIN cases and 50% of low-grade CIN cases could be attributed to HPV infection in Taiwanese women. Because these reports for Taiwanese women were published around 10 years ago. It is important to survey and update the incidence of HPV in CIN and cervical cancer patients in Taiwanese women. We will survey the incidence of HPV infection in 500 cervical cancer patients, 100 patients of CIN and 100 normal population patients.",N/A,True,FEMALE,18 Years,80 Years,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,Taiwan,"Wen-Fang Cheng, MD, PhD",CONTACT,886-2-2312-3456,wenfangcheng@yahoo.com,National Taiwan University Hospital,N/A

However, there is limited research understanding this population, meaning a considerable number of people continue to suffer. The purpose of this study is to 1) identify depression stasis prevalence and predictors in an existing evidenced-based group treatment for depression, 2) run a clinical trial to test whether an embedded intervention based on theoretical and clinical practice evidence can help reduce patient depression stasis and drop-out rates and 3) understand what aspect of therapy produces change (or prevents change in stasis). The study will be based on behavioural activation (BA) therapy delivered in an eight-session group format in an Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service in the United Kingdom. BA is one of the most effective psychotherapies available for depression and focuses on helping patients to increase their engagement with valued activities to help break out of the cycle of depression. Firstly, an archived anonymised dataset of routine depression measures from patients who have previously received the existing group BA treatment will be analysed. Secondly, the group BA treatment delivered to patients in 2017 will be enhanced with two treatment augmentations. One augmentation will target stasis outcomes through the addition of specific 'if-then' planning (known as implementation intentions) when setting between-session homework and the other augmentation will target patient drop-out by informing patients about group BA effectiveness and therapy-dose evidence. The stasis outcomes and drop-out rates from the enhanced treatment in the trial will be compared with the archived outcomes to see if the intervention has had an effect and the role of engaging in valued living as a mechanism of change for depression symptoms will be examined. It is hypothesised that a) 50% of patients who have received the existing BA group treatment for depression will have a stasis outcome, b) there will be a significant reduction in depression stasis outcomes and drop-out rate following the enhanced BA group treatment delivered in the trial and c) engagement in valued living will have a mediating effect on outcome for responding patients following the enhanced BA group treatment but the effect will not be present for patients with a stasis outcome.",34,* Patients who access the Sheffield Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service (United Kingdom) with depression as the primary presenting problem * Patients with co-morbid anxiety symptoms can be included as long as depression is the primary diagnosis * Are referred to and choose the Behavioural Activation Group (BAG) treatment option * Able to attend the BAG intervention * Aged 18 or over,* Primary diagnosis that is not depression * Patients who do not choose BAG as a treatment option * Aged under 18,False,ALL,18 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,United Kingdom,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,University of Sheffield,OTHER

The study will be completed in three phases.

The first phase aims to establish SCD PW marker and PW score scoring system

1. Use big data processing techniques to find out the differences between survivors with ventricular arrhythmias and normal controls. Find out the SCD Pre-warning ECG Marker (PW marker).
2. Establish SCD Pre-warning risk score system according to traditional SCD risk factors, clinical characteristics of patients and abnormal electrocardiogram indicators.
3. According to the established SCD PW marker and PW score scoring system, the original group of patients are classified and scored. After five years of follow-up with sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation as the primary end point and sudden cardiac death as the secondary endpoint, Kaplan-Meier are used to calculate the mortality rate of sudden cardiac death and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The COX proportional hazards regression model is used to further determine and evaluate the SCD predictive value of PW marker and PW score risk factor scoring system.

The second phase is to validate the established PW marker and PW score system models and evaluate the SCD predictive value of it. This stage is divided into two parts:

1. Patients enrolled in traditional high-risk ventricular arrhythmia, will be divided into PW marker positive group and PW marker negative group and join in a 5-year follow-up. Kaplan-Meier is used to calculate the mortality rate of sudden cardiac death and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis is performed to further verify the early warning effect of PW marker on SCD.
2. Patients will be divide into three groups including the low-risk group, middle-risk group and high-risk group according to the PW score risk factor scoring system and join in a 5-year follow-up. Kaplan-Meier is used to calculate the mortality rate of sudden cardiac death, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis is used to further verify the early warning effect of PW score scoring system on SCD.

The third stage is the development stage of SCD early warning equipment. This stage will conduct clinical translational medical studies of PW marker and PW score based on the previous study and develop PW marker and PW score as portable SCD warning device and/or mobile phone APP which will be applied to the clinic for early warning diagnosis of SCD.",2200,"* 1.

Although inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), β-blockers and aldosterone-receptor blockers have improved the treatment of heart failure, mortality of HF remains unacceptably high.

Recently, we identified a key metabolite N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) increased in the plasma of patients with heart failure. Also, elevated plasma Neu5Ac, independent of other traditional risk factors, is associated with poor prognosis in patients with HF in long-term follow up. Neu5Ac levels, the most common sialic acid in mammals, generated from sialylated glycoconjugates by neuraminidase. Neu5Ac and its regulatory enzyme neuraminidase play a key role in heart failure. We found neuraminidase inhibitor could reduce Neu5Ac levels and improve heart failure in mice model, providing opportunity for a novel therapeutic strategy in HF. Neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir is also an old anti-influenza drug. Using oseltamivir may be a new therapeutic strategy in heart failure.

Based on above information, we designed the randomized, open-label, blank-controlled study in patients with chronic HF to receive either oseltamivir or placebo, in addition to standard HF therapy to Identify the effect of oseltamivir on serum Neu5Ac level in patients with heart failure and assess the clinic outcomes of level in patients with heart failure using oseltamivir.",388,N/A,N/A,False,ALL,18 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,China,"Li Ni, Phd",CONTACT,862783662479,nili@tjh.tjmu.edu.cn,Tongji Hospital,N/A

ST does not have the volatile constituents and carbon monoxide (CO) that are found in cigarette smoke. Since ST is not smoked there would be less risk of cardiovascular and lung disease. In addition the harm associated with second hand smoke would be eliminated. Although the health risks are reduced in ST users, they still exist due to the presence of nitrosamines found in ST. A better approach would be to use nicotine replacement that did not contain carcinogens, however the cost of such NRT could be prohibitive especially in third world countries where the rate of smoking is continuing to rise and the per capita income is much lower than in the United States.

NCT06854679,Dose Escalated Radiotherapy for Rectal Cancers Using MR-guided Radiotherapy,A Feasibility Study in Dose Escalated Treatment in Rectal Cancer on Mr-Linac Using Mr GuidED Adaptive Radiotherapy,RECRUITING,2025-02-14,2029-01-13,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,Rectal Adenocarcinoma,Radiotherapy dose escalation,Number of patients completing 90% or more fractions delivered on MR-Linac.,"Standard radiotherapy in the UK involves having daily chemotherapy tablets with radiotherapy treatment for 5 weeks at a dose of 52.5Gy to the rectal cancer over 25 fractions. This is the likely treatment participants will be having if they decide not to take part in this study. Increasing the dose to 60Gy is shown to increase the chance that rectal cancer will be treated completely, a term known as ""complete pathological response"". Patients who have a complete pathological response after their treatment can avoid surgery and enter into a surveillance programme to monitor for early signs of the cancer returning. Surveillance can mean 3-6 months camera tests and MRI scans depending on the local unit. If these patients continue to show signs of complete pathological response then they can avoid long term complications from surgery such as a stoma. Unit studies have shown that that increasing the dose of radiotherapy can cause slightly more bowel and bladder side effects, but using adaptive radiotherapy to limit radiotherapy to normal tissue could keep the rate of bothersome side effects as low, which is similar as standard treatment.

All adaptive treatments within this trial will be delivered on a state of the art, radiotherapy machine called an MR-linac (Magnetic Resonance Linear Accelerator). It combines an MRI scanner with a radiotherapy treatment machine called a Linear Accelerator (called a 'linac' for short). The use of the MR-linac means there is no extra radiation dose given when taking daily images to check for the position of participants rectal cancer (unlike CT scans or X-ray). It also enables the investigators to adapt or 'tweak' the radiotherapy plan each day to match the exact position of the rectal cancer and adjacent organs. The non-adaptive fractions can be delivered on either the MR-Linac or CT-linac depending on factors such as treatment machine availability.

The investigators will deliver the treatment on the MR-linac using a technique called intensity modulated radiotherapy (precise X-ray treatment, called IMRT for short). IMRT is able to mould radiotherapy treatment according to what the investigators can see, therefore enabling the investigators to give highly targeted treatment. The investigators already have considerable experience in delivering radiotherapy to rectal cancer with this machine and now wish to focus on whether they could increase dose to benefit long term outcome for all rectal cancer patients as well as reducing the side effects of treatment.

The purpose of this research is to increase the dose to rectal cancer while adapting to the changes that the investigators can see to the rectal cancer during treatment. This means that if the rectal cancer is seen to reduce in size they will be able to deliver a 'shrinking boost' according to what can be seen. This will enable the investigators to give high dose radiotherapy to the cancer whilst limiting radiotherapy to healthy tissue. Without the ability to adapt to changes that the investigators see to the tumour throughout the entire treatment course, standard treatment delivers dose to a larger area of surrounding healthy tissue to ensure that the tumour is sufficiently targeted.

The investigators want to find out if by using this adaptive, shrinking boost approach, they can safely increase radiotherapy dose to rectal cancer, whilst limiting the side effects you experience, in comparison with standard treatment. If this is possible, then this would lead into further clinical trial where the investigators would compare outcomes of higher-dose treatment to standard-of-care. The investigators can't be certain that the side effects will be different, and they don't know if this treatment results in the best chance of cancer cure. However they know from other studies that this is the likely outcome, with surgery being delayed for patients. Patients who have a complete pathological response after combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment enter into a surveillance programme where MRI and camera tests (flexible sigmoidoscopy) are performed at regular intervals looking for early signs of cancer returning.

The investigators expect that the chance of participants having a complete pathological response with this technique is higher than with standard dose, although the investigators can't know this for sure until they have completed further studies.

Primary goal: To generate information on the efficacy of DLE as an aid in symptomatic treatment, by reducing the signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infection (suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19).

Secondary goals:

1. To evaluate clinical deterioration and respiratory alarm data.
2. To evaluate the duration of the clinical picture.
3. To explore cytokine changes associated with the therapeutic effect induced by DLE.
4. To obtain data on the safety of DLE as an aid in the symptomatic treatment of acute respiratory infection (suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19).
5. To generate information to validate the contingency scale to assess the severity of acute respiratory disease (suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19).

Justification The systemic inflammatory response has been recognized as being responsible for COVID-19 complications. Immunomodulation strategies to control it are currently being considered, including the use of systemic steroids to down-regulate the systemic inflammatory response, the use of human immunoglobulin and even chloroquine given its anti-inflammatory and antiviral qualities; however, none of these treatments has been sufficiently studied or has shown any significant change in the clinical course of infected patients.

Due to the importance of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the absence of specific treatment, it is important to implement new treatments that allow modulating the immune response, and one strategy may be the addition of DLE to symptomatic and supportive treatment.

Hypotheses by goals.

1. The addition of DLE to the symptomatic treatment could decrease the severity of the clinical outcome (signs and symptoms) in individuals with an acute respiratory infection (cases suspected/confirmed by COVID-19).
2. The addition of DLE to the symptomatic treatment could decrease the clinical deterioration due to the acute respiratory infectious process (suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19).
3. The addition of DLE to the symptomatic treatment could decrease the duration of the clinical outcome (suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19).",562,"* Person of any age that has presented at least two of the following signs and symptoms: cough, fever or headache",N/A,False,ALL,18 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,Mexico,"Melissa I Espinosa-Navarro, MD",CONTACT,+525557296000,melissa.espinosa@useic.com.mx,"National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico",N/A

In macular edema, blood vessels in the retina, a thin layer of tissue that lines the back of the eye become leaky and the retina swells. The macula, the center part of the retina that is responsible for fine vision may also swell, causing vision loss. Traditional laser treatment (argon blue or green or yellow) for macular swelling, or edema, causes scarring that can expand and possibly lead to more loss of vision. Studies with a different type of laser (diode) may be less damaging. The results of this study on side effects of the treatments will be used to design a larger study of effectiveness. This study will also examine whether celecoxib (Celebrex® (Registered Trademark)), an anti-arthritis drug that reduces inflammation and swelling, can reduce inflammation and swelling of the retina. Patients with elevated cholesterol levels will be invited to participate in a cholesterol reduction part of the study to compare normal-pace cholesterol reduction with accelerated reduction.

Patients 18 years of age and older with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and macular edema that requires laser treatment may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with the following tests and procedures:

* Medical history: to review past medical conditions and treatments.
* Physical examination: to measure vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, temperature, breathing rate) and examine the head and neck, heart, lungs, abdomen, arms and legs.
* Eye examination: to assess visual acuity (eye chart test) and examine pupils, lens, retina, and eye movements. The pupils will be dilated with drops for this examination.
* Blood tests: to measure cholesterol, blood clotting time, hemoglobin A1C (a measure of diabetes control), and to evaluate liver and kidney function.
* Eye photography: to help evaluate the status of the retina and changes that may occur in the future. Special photographs of the inside of the eye are taken using a camera that flashes a bright light into the eye. From 2 to 20 pictures may be taken, depending on the eye condition.
* Fluorescein angiography: to evaluate the eye's blood vessels. A yellow dye is injected into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the retina are taken using a camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible blood vessel abnormality.

Participants will be randomly assigned to take celecoxib or placebo (an inactive, look-alike pill). Participants who have elevated cholesterol levels may return for a brief visit after 1 month. All patients will return for follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients who require laser treatment will be randomly assigned to one of the two laser treatments. For these procedures, eye drops are put in the eye to numb the surface and a contact lens is placed on the eye during the laser beam application. Several visits may be required for additional laser treatments. The maximum number of treatments depends on how well the treatment is working. Patients who respond well to the study medication may receive no laser treatments. After the first year, patients will be followed every 6 months until either the patient returns for a 3-year visit, the last enrolled patient returns for the 1-year visit, or the patient requests to leave the study.

Vascular permeability is controlled by endothelial glycocalyx. Several factors such as sepsis, ischemia / reperfusion, inflammatory mediators, trauma, surgery including the Cesarean Section and fluid overload can increase vascular permeability due to a glycocalyx damage.

During Cesarean Section under subarachnoid anesthesia, hypotension may occur. It is a common side effect caused by reduced preload due to aortocaval compression by the uterus. Furthermore, subarachnoid anesthesia causes block of the sympathetic preganglionic fibers which is associated with vasodilation. These changes often require the use of vasopressors and fluids.

A fluid overload associated with the physiological and pathological factors discussed earlier might cause an increased risk of pulmonary edema and acute respiratory failure (IRA) in women undergoing cesarean section under arachnoid anesthesia.

IRA occurs in less than 0.2% of total pregnancies but it is one of the most common cause of admission to intensive care unit in pregnant women.

Among the causes that can lead to IRA in the last trimester of pregnancy we find pneumopathies such as asthma, pulmonary embolism due to amniotic fluid and pulmonary edema related to severe preeclampsia.

Diagnosis of pulmonary edema can be clinical or sub-clinical through laboratory tests such as BNP (b-type natriuretic peptide). It might also be necessary to execute instrumental examinations such as chest radiography (contraindicated in pregnancy) or trans-thoracic ultrasound.

An alarming one-third of KT patients experience MNA even though the problem is preventable. Adherence intervention studies have proven marginally effective for those with acute and chronic illnesses and ineffective for adult KT recipients. Using a randomized controlled trial design with an attention-control group, this R01 will test an innovative 6-month SystemCHANGE intervention to enhance immunosuppressive MA in adult non-adherent KT recipients. This intervention shows great promise for increasing MA with a large effect size of 1.4 in our pilot study.

The Medication Event Monitoring System cap, which contains microelectronics that record the date and time of the cap removal, will be used to measure MA.

It is a pre-malignant condition and may progress to low grade dysplasia, high grade dysplasia and ultimately esophageal adenocarcinoma which has poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of only 5-20%.Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a standard modality and well-studied endoscopic treatment for dysplastic BE. While the rate of complete eradication of dysplasia has been reported to be between 78% - 94% with RFA, the rate of complications associated with this procedure has been reported to be as high as 19.1%, and the costs are high. In a randomized clinical trial in patients with BE and low-grade dysplasia by Phoa et al in 2014, 68 patients underwent radiofrequency ablation therapy with a median of three ablation sessions per patient while 68 patients were randomized to endoscopic surveillance. In this study, a total of 13 patients (19.1%) experienced an adverse event in the treatment group versus no adverse events in the control group. Eight patients (11.8%) developed esophageal strictures which required a median of one dilation, three patients were noted to have small mucosal lacerations, one patient developed retrosternal pain treated with analgesics while one patient developed abdominal pain requiring hospitalization and treatment with analgesia. Several other studies have reported the rate of complications ranging between 5% to 19.1% and stricture formation being the most common among them.

PCOS is one of the most common endocrine disorders among females. Features can include anovulation (eggs are not released from the ovaries) resulting in irregular menstrual periods, excessive amounts of androgenic (male) hormones resulting in acne and hirsutism (excessive hair growth on the face and body), and polycystic ovaries (small sac-like structures \[cysts\] on your ovaries) seen on ultrasound. Girls with PCOS also have higher levels of insulin in their bodies (called hyperinsulinism) but are not able to use insulin very well (called insulin resistance) resulting in an increased risk of diabetes. Diabetes is when you have high levels of glucose (sugar) in your blood. Many studies have looked at how bodies respond to glucose and have shown that compared to Caucasians, healthy African-Americans produce much more insulin (hyperinsulinism) but are not able to use it as well (insulin resistance) in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose move from the blood into the muscles for the body to use as energy. PCOS is associated with increased levels of insulin (hyperinsulinism) and not being able to use it as well (insulin resistance). So we want to see if there is a difference in insulin production (secretion) and insulin resistance between African-Americans and Caucasians girls with PCOS. To do this, we will look at blood glucose and insulin levels in response to giving glucose in African-American and Caucasian girls who have PCOS. The results of this study may ultimately help to more effectively target treatment therapy in individuals with PCOS that have increased insulin secretion and/or increased insulin resistance.",12,"* Children and adolescents ages 12-18 years * African-American and Caucasian females * Menarchal for at least 2 years * Hemoglobin A1C \<6.5% * Medical Condition: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) - based on AES criteria: HA in addition to ANOV and/or PCO * Hyperandrogenism (required): Serum Testosterone \> 50 ng/dl or Free Testosterone (%) \> 1.4% or Free Testosterone \> 7 pg/mL * Oligo- and/or Anovulation: menstrual cycles lengths \> 35 days and/or \< 8 menstrual cycles a year * Polycystic Ovaries: transabdominal or trans-vaginal ultrasound finding of 12 or more follicles measuring 2-6 mm in diameter or increased ovarian volume (\> 10 mL) * Medications: Medication-naive to treatment therapy with Metformin, Oral Contraceptives, and Anti-androgen medications","* Ages \<12 or \>18 * Prepubertal, Premenarche * Hemoglobin A1C ≥6.5% * Medical Conditions: Hypothyroidism, Hyperthyroidism, Diabetes Mellitus, Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, Hyperprolactinemia, Pregnancy * Medications: Past and/or Present treatment therapy with Metformin, Oral Contraceptives, Anti-androgen medications, Insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents",False,FEMALE,12 Years,18 Years,CHILD; ADULT,United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Nationwide Children's Hospital,OTHER

The distal part of the radial artery (wrist) is the preferred access site.

The potential complications of the procedure are mostly minor and comprise temporary occlusion of the radial artery (RA), hematoma, local infection or bleeding from the puncture site. Major complications including vessel aneurysm or occlusion with threat to hand viability are rare.

The standard approach to catheterization is ""blind"" puncture of the RA while locating its pulse by palpation, followed by threading a 20 Gauge (20G) angio-catheter into the vessel. Alternatively ultrasound can be used to locate the vessel and guide needle insertion.

To our knowledge, four prospective randomized trials (PRT)5-8 comparing palpation with ultrasound-guided RA catheterization have been conducted so far and one meta-analysis looked at the pooled data obtained from these. The results showed that ultrasound guidance increased the first-attempt success rate at RA catheterization by 71% compared to palpation. The use of ultrasound also significantly reduced the time to successful catheterization, the number of punctures as well as the amount of catheters required per procedure.

None of the prior randomized trials has been conducted in an ICU setting and in three out of the four studies the arterial lines were placed in patients undergoing elective surgery. The investigators hypothesized that ultrasound could improve first attempt success rate while placing arterial catheters in an ICU setting. Ultrasound may also reduce total time to successful insertion and reduce complications.

The investigators plan to randomize patients to either a palpation technique or ultrasound guided catheter insertion and record the above outcomes.",50,"* All surgical intensive care unit patients at Yale New Haven Hospital in whom the indication for arterial catheterization has been established by the attending physician will be eligible for consented randomization to either the ""Palpation"" or the ""Ultrasound"" group.",* The patient or his/her surrogate declines to participate or the patient lacks a radial artery into which a catheter can be place.,False,ALL,16 Years,N/A,CHILD; ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,United States,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Yale University,OTHER

Ketamine is an agent that is capable of providing both pain control and sedation while having either minimal effect on breathing or promoting spontaneous breathing. Combining Ketamine with Propofol has the potential to reduce the total amount of Propofol used resulting in a procedure being performed under the same level of sedation but without the downside of reduced spontaneous breathing.

If this intervention is successful, this study will yield new knowledge about the effects of this innovative intervention. Also, an innovative VR intervention will be available to promote the mental well-being of older residents in LTCF.

Trial design This study employs a single-blinded, two-parallel-group (intervention-to-control group ratio=1:1), non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial.

Study setting This study will be conducted in the LTCF. Participants will be recruited from Care \& Attention Homes for the Elderly and Nursing Homes under the governance of the Social Welfare Department in Hong Kong.

Eligibility criteria Inclusion: 1) Aged 60 years or above; 2) LTCF residents; and 3) Physical disability, defined as the Modified Barthel Index (MBI) score of ≤ 90 (i.e., moderately dependent or worse). Exclusion: 1) Probably dementia, as defined by a Montreal Cognitive Assessment score of \< 20, 2) Severe visual impairment, as defined by a lens-corrected visual acuity score of \< 6/60, 3) Severe hearing impairment, as defined by failed whispered voice test, 4) Bilateral upper limb paralysis, as defined by the Medical Research Council Muscle Power Scale of \< 4, or 5) Participated in any VR activities in the past six months or concurrently.

Consent All participants will be asked to give their written informed consent to participate in the proposed study.

Groups Participants allocated to the intervention group will participate in the 6-week VR experience programme. Participants allocated to the control will receive the usual care provided by the LTCF, such as personal care, regular basic medical and nursing care, and social support, as committed by the Social Welfare Department. The participants allocated to the intervention group receive the same usual care provided by the LTCF. The research team does not interfere with the services provided to the participants in either group.

Outcomes Demographic data including age, gender, level of education, number of chronic illnesses, length of stay in the LTCF, and experience of participation in VR activities will be collected. Outcomes include mental well-being, depressive symptoms, loneliness, health-related quality of life, and perceived social support.

Participant timeline Potential participants will be recruited in the phase of Enrolment, in which the eligibility screen and informed consent will be implemented. Then, in the phase of the Pre-treatment Assessment (i.e., T0,), demographic and outcome data will be collected. Subsequently, in the phase allocation, participants will be randomly allocated to either the therapeutic virtual reality experience group or the control group. Then, interventions will be implemented. In the phase of the Post-treatment Assessment (i.e., T1), outcome data will be collected once again.

Analysis methods Demographic and outcome data collected at baseline will be reported either as means with standard deviation or as frequencies with percentages according to their levels of measurement as a whole sample and by groups. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) will be employed to separately test the hypothesis on the five outcomes as dependent variables (i.e., mental well-being, depressive symptoms, loneliness, health-related quality of life, perceived social support), The independent variables will be the same across all GEEs: group (two categories: intervention and control groups), timepoint (two categories: T0 and T1), and group x timepoint. The primary interpretation of the results will be based on the intention-to-treat analysis without adjusting for covariates. The level of significance will be set at 0.05.

They are referred to as potentially inappropriate medications or medications that are best avoided by older adults. The accumulated evidence has now shifted the clinical and research focus to evaluating the who, what, and how of the best way to deprescribe (i.e., dose reduction or cessation of these medications). The Drug Burden Index (DBI) allows researchers and clinicians to quantify the cumulative burden of anticholinergic and sedative medications in each patient. Deprescribing these medications is a complex health intervention based on trade-offs between their clinical benefits (e.g., symptom management and prevention of diseases) and their adverse drug events to improve physical and cognitive function. Existing physical function performance metrics, such as gait speed captured in the clinic, are often non-specific and do not reflect real-life performance. Innovative mobility metrics are required to better understand specific deficits with age and disease and the effects of medications on these deficits.

The goal of this project is to better characterize the impact of reducing the anticholinergic and sedative medication burden on physical function in older adults by novel mobility metrics in lab and real-life environments.

A prospective, longitudinal cohort of 182 community-dwelling older adults (≥ 65 years) with a DBI of ≥ 1 will be completed. Using a quasi-experimental design, recruited patients will undergo a medication deprescribing plan, as part of usual clinical care, that includes three gradual changes to their medication regimen resulting in three DBI levels. At each DBI level, physical function mobility including dual-task tests) will be assessed in the lab with wearable sensors during validated clinical tests such as the Short Physical Performance Battery. Objective balance and mobility metrics (e.g., sway area and frequency, stride length) will be extracted. Physical function will also be assessed continuously in the patient's real-life environment from recruitment to the last lab visit, using wearable (Apple Watch® with ankle inertial measurement unit) and environmental sensors.

CVD risk factors can be modifiable (nutrition, physical activity, obesity, smoking, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and diabetes) and non-modifiable (age, gender, ethnicity, family history and socioeconomic status). Chronic exposure to CVD risk factors induces oxidative stress and promotes inflammation. In addition, endothelial cells in response to the inflammatory reaction secrete growth factors, leading to the destruction of vascular endothelium and promoting atherogenesis.

Oxidative stress refers to the imbalance between anti-oxidant and pro-oxidant compounds, with predominance of the pro-oxidant ones. Reactive Oxygen Species overproduction has been implicated in pathogenesis and complications of numerous diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and chronic kidney disease.

Moreover, endothelium consists of a single layer of endothelial cells; it is the natural barrier between blood and tissues and also an endocrine organ. It plays a key role in vascular homeostasis by maintaining a balance between vasodilation and vasoconstriction and is responsible for fluid filtration, blood vessel tone, hormone trafficking, hemostasis, regulation of blood flow and growth of blood vessels. Thus, reductions in endothelial function are detrimental and predict and precede the development of overt CVD.

Sesame belongs to Pedaliaceae family and can be consumed in different forms such as seeds, oil or tahini, i.e., a 100 % peeled, ground and roasted sesame paste. Tahini is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, proteins, vitamin E and lignans, such as sesamin, sesamolin and sesamol. Recent studies have indicated that tahini consumption can lower blood pressure and pulse rate and improve endothelial function and glycemic response in healthy males postprandially.

However, only two studies are available in the current literature concerning the effect on diabetes, one of them in patients with type 2 diabetes and one in diabetic animal model. Thus, the aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of tahini consumption on oxidative stress, blood pressure, endothelial function and arterial stiffness in patients with type 2 diabetes postprandially.",12,* minimum period from diagnosis three years * good glycemic control (HbA1c \<7%) * taking a stable anti-diabetic treatment for the last 3 months (anti-diabetic tablets only),-,False,ALL,40 Years,70 Years,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,Greece,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Harokopio University,OTHER

Their etiology can vary widely (spontaneous, iatrogenic, post-surgical perforation, anastomotic dehiscence, inflammatory process) and their treatment is complex, sometimes unresolved, and often requires a multidisciplinary approach. The chronicity of digestive and pelvic organ fistulas (e.g., vagino-vesical fistulas) is related to tissue repair mechanisms, which are delayed and subverted in favor of fibrotic and inflammatory processes. In these cases, the wound healing cascade stops at the inflammatory phase and does not result in the proliferation phase. The transition depends on changing levels of cytokines and growth factors. In the persistence of the inflammatory phase, polymorphonucleates and macrophages are active, phagocytosing and releasing enzymes that also damage healthy tissue. In this context, the anti-inflammatory, angiogenic, antiapoptotic, and tissue regenerative effects of adipose tissue-derived stromal or stem cells (ADSCs) could play a decisive role. In fact, ADSCs exhibit immunosuppressive properties on the proliferation of T cells, B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells and modulate inflammation by implanting a regenerative niche with appropriate paracrine communication and subsequent tissue regeneration. ""Fat grafting"" has a wide range of application: it started with plastic surgery and regenerative medicine, then in orthopedics, maxillofacial surgery, and vascular surgery. Since 2019, a new procedure using processed fat grafting for the treatment of chronic fistulas of the gastrointestinal tract and pelvic organs has been initiated at the Agostino Gemelli IRCCS University Polyclinic Foundation and has become ""standard of care,"" with good results. The procedure is quick, safe, minimally invasive and cost-effective. Subcutaneous fat, immediately after harvesting from the same patient, is mechanically stimulated with oscillatory movements, then injected under endoscopic vision directly onto the orifice of the fistula. When the fat is centrifuged, it stimulates the activation of various mesenchymal stemness-related genes, such as Sox2, Nanog and Oct4. The increase in mRNAs is tens to hundreds of times and is accompanied by a pronounced increase in the expression of the anti-inflammatory protein TSG6 and suppression of TNFalpha, normally expressed by adipose tissue.

The objective of the study is to treat chronic fistula of the gastrointestinal tract and pelvic organs of any type, symptomatic and/or impacting quality of life, in whom all other treatments (medical, endoscopic, or surgical) have failed or are not candidates.

Specific objectives To compare changes in the immunophenotype and ex-vivo T-cell functional tests from samples of peripheral blood and measurement in the urine of messenger RNA for FoxP3,in kidney transplant recipients given or not syngeneic (from the recipient) MSC infusion under basiliximab/low-dose RATG induction therapy and maintenance immunosuppressive treatment with low-dose cyclosporine (CsA) plus low-dose mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).

This will assess at different time up to 12 months post transplant. In addition the safety profile of MSC infusion will be investigated. We have planned to start with the safety and biological/mechanistic study in 6 living-related kidney transplant recipients. Three patients will receive ex-vivo expanded syngeneic MSC infusion (2x106 MSCs per kilogram body weight) at the time of kidney transplant, and 3 additional patients no cells (controls), both under the cover of induction therapy with basiliximab and low-dose RATG, and maintenance immunosuppression with low-dose CsA and MMF. Randomization to MSC or no cell infusion will be performed at the time the recipient will sign the informed consent to participate to the study.

Should this biological/mechanistic ex vivo studies document that MSC infusion allows the development of an immune microenvironment permissive to graft tolerance, a pilot efficacy study to achieve operational tolerance after complete withdrawal of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy will follow.

Secondary Objectives: To investigate familial aggregation of prostate cancer in blacks and whites. To determine whether screening behavior differs in men diagnosed with early stage prostate cancer versus those with later stage disease as well as to determine if screening behavior differences exist between blacks and whites.

Primary Outcomes: The primary outcomes are pesticide, occupational and chemical exposure, and dietary history. Other major endpoints include: 1) familial aggregation of prostate cancer; 2) weight, weight history, and weight cycling; 3) subject's knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors about prostate cancer; and 4) treatment choices.

Intervention: N/A

Study Abstract: Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in American men. Among African Americans the incidence and mortality from prostate cancer is even greater. Although incidence rates in the Southern United States tend to be only slightly higher than that of the nation, a clear discrepancy exists between national mortality rates and those in the Southeastern United States. Notably high rates, particularly among African Americans are observed and in North Carolina the prostate cancer mortality rate among African Americans is the highest of any state in the nation. In spite of these statistics, very little is known about racially based differences in the etiology of this disease.

This study hypothesizes that racial differences in the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer may be a result of multiple factors including those that are socioeconomic, environmental, dietary and genetic. This research will provide insight into gene-environmental interactions that initiate and promote prostatic neoplasia as well as address whether there are differences in patterns of care which impact morbidity and survival. The results of this study will also be compared to findings in non-veterans that are being generated through an NCI-funded sister study of these issues under the direction of co-investigator, Dr. JoEllen Schildkraut of Duke University.

However, many patients are refractory to this treatment and suffer from chronic pain over years, leading to a worsening of the quality of live. The mobilization of these patients is one main goal in the therapy of these chronic and inflammatory diseases. Low dose radiation therapy (LDRT) is applied since more than one century for the local treatment of chronic degenerating joint diseases. The success of the treatment was described by many retrospective as well as pattern of care studies, respectively.

Local (only at the painful joint) low dose irradiation of the chronic patients results in most patients in a significantly reduced pain, not only direct after the therapy, but also lasting for more than 12 month in many cases. The patients experience enhanced mobility and increased quality of life. The molecular and cellular processes leading to the pain reduction are just fragmentarily analyzed. Our group revealed that macrophages are key players in radiation-induced immune modulation. Inflammatory macrophages exposed to low doses of radiation showed a reduced inflammatory capacity and attenuated an inflammatory microenvironment. Besides macrophages further immune cells are most likely involved in reduction of inflammation following LD-RT, as in vitro already shown for neutrophils.

The IMMO-LDRT01 study aims for the first time to analyze in detail the immune status of patients suffering from inflammatory, chronic joint diseases before, during and after LD-RT in a longitudinal manner. The multi-color flow cytometry-based assay will allow determining over 30 immune cell subsets and additionally their activation status. Further, biodosimetry will be performed with the whole-blood samples to get hints about dose that the immune cells are exposed to. This will be performed with national and international co-operation partners.

The IMMO-LDRT01 study is a prospective and observational study not influencing the standard therapeutic scheme and will provide hints how the LDRT affects besides local cells in the irradiated area also the systemic inflammatory response.",250,"* Patients suffering and diagnosed for: * painful shoulder syndrome (periarthritis humeroscapularis) * painful elbow syndrome (Epicondylopathia humeri) * benign achillodynia * benign calcaneodynia * arthosis (finger- , rhiz-, gon-, and anklearthrosis * arthritis (gon- and anklearthrosis) * Planned local low dose radiation therapy (LDRT) at the Department of Radiation Oncology, Universitätsklinikum Erlangen. * Age at least 18 years",* patients who are suffering or had suffered from any malignant diseases * fertile patients who refuse effective contraception during study treatment * persistent drug and/or alcohol abuse * patients not able or willing to behave according to study protocol * patients in care * patients that are not able to speak German,False,ALL,18 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,Germany,"Benjamin Frey, PhD",CONTACT,+49 9131 85 44248,benjamin.frey@uk-erlangen.de,University of Erlangen-Nürnberg Medical School,N/A

TXA suppresses the viability of multiple human/murine cancer cell lines and Plasmin formation, which prevents cleavage of the CDCP1 protein to a more oncogenic form. TXA appears to act through additional anticancer mechanisms that include reduction of S6K1 and STAT3 phosphorylation on sites required for their activation.

Uptake by cancer results in blockade of protein synthesis, and alter signaling through the amino acid-sensitive mTORC1/S6K1 and GCN2/eiF2a/ATF4 pathways. This is expected to induce autophagy, which may mediate some of the biological effects of TXA on cells. This effect of TXA is expected to be most prominent in cells that rely on high levels of basal protein synthesis such as cancer cells. Currently no clinical treatment in this space to spare or improve surgical outcomes.

Positive results could help reduce tumor size and suppress new cancer cell production before surgical interventions are taken.

However, several factors can contribute to perception errors including: different lighting variables, multiple shade systems available in the market with lack of standardization in color systems and corresponding porcelain systems, individual human variables in color perception and lack of understanding of color science.

Therefore, in order to eliminate the uncontrolled variables during the color matching process, instrumental methods have been developed. Spectrophotometric measurement methods employing computer calculations, based on color science and theories, allow quantitative evaluation which is objective and appears to be more accurate. However, extremely high costs, relatively low performance with respect to agreements of the computer-aided devices, and edge loss error make it less acceptable.

One of the most powerful tools in communicating with both patients and dental ceramists is digital photography. Hence, this study is designed to explore the possibilities of a novel approach to shade management (eLABor_aid) utilizing a photocolorimetric (PCM) method and subsequent shade formulation without the use of stock shade guides in comparison to well-known visual and instrumental methods.

The aim of the study is to evaluate the accuracy of digital photography combined with shade analyzing software (eLAB) in optimizing shade matching when compared to conventional and instrumental methods of shade selection.

Among these lymphomas, follicular lymphomas (FLs), marginal zone lymphomas (MZLs) and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) emerge as the most prevalent entities. While FL and MZL are representative of indolent B-cell lymphomas, characterized by a slow progression of the disease and favorable clinical outcomes, DLBCL stands out as an aggressive lymphoma, often occuring from the transformation of a pre-existing indolent lymphoma.

Chromosome translocations are a hallmark of some NHL subtypes, offering insights into their molecular pathogenesis. For instance, the conventional FL is genetically characterized by the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation, found in 85-90% of cases, resulting in sustained elevation of the antiapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2). However, certain FL cases lack BCL2 translocations and exhibit distinct clinical, morphological and phenotypical features with genetic heterogeneity.

A subset of BCL2-negative FLs displays rearrangements within chromosomal region 3q27, inducing abnormal modulation of B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) expression. The BCL6 gene plays a critical role in germinal center development and B-cell differentiation. Previous investigations indicate that BCL6 rearrangements (BCL6-R) manifest distinct pathological and genetic features, diverging from classical FL presentations.

FLs carrying BCL6-R commonly share a specific CD10- Bcl-2- Bcl-6+ phenotype, often accompanied by a monocytoid component and increased frequency of diffuse architectural patterns. Patients with BCL6-R tend to exhibit advanced clinical stages and complex genetic profiles.

MZLs present differential diagnostic challenges due to shared monocytoid components, phenotypes traits, and common genetic features. The similarities observed between BCL6-R FL and MZL suggest a convergence in both morphological and genetic aspects, leading to intricate differentiation. Traditionally, these indolent NHLs with BCL6-R were categorized as FL and incorporated into the FL category in the WHO classification. However, few studies highlight the occurrence of BCL6-R in MZLs. This observation gives rise to the hypothesis that indolent NHLs exhibiting BCL6-R might correspond to a continuum comprising both FL and MZL.

Additionally, BCL6-R has been frequently documented in DLBCL cases with residual MZL component. These DLBCL cases might display a mutational profile reminiscent of MZL. This suggests a plausible origin of BCL6-R DLBCL from indolent BCL6-R MZLs or BCL6-R FLs cases.",135,* Diagnostic of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at anatomy and cytology department of Lyon Sud hospital * Rearrangement of the BCL6 gene detected by FISH analysis * Diagnostic of the disease between january 2016 and december 2023,"* Patients diagnosed with primary cutaneous centrofollicular B lymphoma, composite lymphoma, anaplastic B lymphoma or primary B lymphoma of the mediastinum. * Presence of a rearrangement of the BLC2 gene or the CMYC gene in FISH * Presence of a non-significant BCL6 gene rearrangement (\<5% of rearranged cells)",False,ALL,25 Years,100 Years,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,France,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Hospices Civils de Lyon,OTHER

Whether the choice of the mode used to target low tidal volumes and low inspiratory plateau pressures affects clinical outcomes for critically ill adults receiving mechanical ventilation is unknown. All three modes of mechanical ventilation are commonly used in clinical practice. A large, multicenter randomized trial comparing available modes of mechanical ventilation is needed to understand the effect of each mode on clinical outcomes.

This immunomodulating response results in a higher risk of secondary infections and is associated to 2/3 of deaths related to septic shocks. Follow up of patients' immune status with time is crucial to guide therapy management.

Despite these differences in composition, both sugars possess identical energy contribution on a gram to gram basis (4). However, the higher ratio of fructose to glucose in HFCS has led to the hypothesis that HFCS may uniquely contribute to cardiometabolic risk, more so than sucrose, through proposed differences in fructose metabolism, endocrine and hedonic properties (5).

During this time, we will use the air breathed out to calculate how much blood per minute the subject's heart is pumping.

Traditionally, opioids have played an important role in treating postoperative pain. It is well established that opioids are highly effective in relieving pain; however opioids are associated with numerous side effects that include nausea, vomiting, constipation, ileus, bladder dysfunction, respiratory depression, pruritus, drowsiness, sedation, and allergic reaction. These opioid side effects, which range in severity, can significantly interfere with discharge home following colorectal surgery. Significant interest exists in the use of local anesthetic based regional anesthesia techniques as a means to extend the analgesic window for patients undergoing colorectal surgery. Specifically, the use of the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block as an adjunct in postoperative pain control has been widely reported in the anesthesia and colorectal surgery literature. Historically, the block was performed in a blind fashion with relative success and presently the block is typically performed either with ultrasound guidance or laparoscopic visualization. While TAP block has shown to be effective in post-operative pain control, the techniques used to place the block have not formally been compared.

The investigators are purposing a prospective, patient-blinded, randomized study of patients undergoing major colorectal surgery to compare TAP block under ultrasound guidance versus laparoscopic visualization versus no TAP block. The investigators hypothesize that laparoscopic-guided TAP block is non-inferior to ultrasound-guided TAP block with respect to perioperative pain control and either technique is superior to no TAP. In addition the investigators will measure procedural time, any adverse events related to the block, overall postoperative analgesic requirement, analgesic duration, postoperative pain scores, length of postoperative hospital stay, incidence of postoperative ileus, and overall patient satisfaction between the three groups.",127,N/A,* Patient refusal to regional blockade * Infection at the site of needle insertion * Systemic infection * Bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy (as diagnosed by history or laboratory evaluation),True,ALL,18 Years,90 Years,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,OTHER

GD patients showed increased functional connectivity between regions of the PFC and mesolimbic reward system, as well as reduced connectivity in the area of the PFC. The altered interaction between prefrontal structures and the mesolimbic reward system in GD shares similarity with functional organization reported in Substances Use Disorders (SUDs), suggesting a more general pathophysiology for addictive disorders

Objectives: To test if rTMS can reduce craving and playing in Gambling Disorder, and also affect several mood, behavioral and cognitive alterations associated with prolonged Gambling Disorder.

Eligibility: Healthy, right-handed adults ages 18-65 who do have Gambling Disorder.

Design: This is a non-randomized, open label study. The study includes three phases: 1) a rTMS continued treatment phase; 2) a rTMS follow-up; and 3) a no rTMS follow-up.

Prior to participating, participants will be screened with:

* Questionnaires
* Cognitive tests
* Medical history
* Physical exam

After being enrolled, baseline behavioral and imaging data will be collected. In particular, participants will undergo:

* Questionnaires
* Cognitive tests

During the continued rTMS phase, participants with Gambling Disorder will receive real rTMS. Repetitive TMS will be delivered during 10 outpatient treatment days, over 2 weeks (5 days/week). Following this phase, subjects will have 12 follow-up visits (once/weekly), during which they will receive rTMS, and behavioral assessments will be performed. At the end of the rTMS follow up period, participants will further receive 3 follow up visits (once a month), during which rTMS will not be performed, but behavioral data will be collected.

Treatment includes:

* rTMS: A coil is placed on the head. Brief electrical current passes through the coil. At each visit, participants will receive two rTMS sessions, with a 1hr interval between sessions. At the beginning of each rTMS session, they view gambling-related images for few minutes.

Some neuroendocrine tumours, termed functional NETs, overproduce hormones which result in a variety of symptoms. However, approximately 75% of NETs are considered non-functional meaning that they do not result in hormone overproduction. The main treatment for both functional and non-functional NETs is somatostatin analogues (SSA, a type of inhibitory hormone). These drugs slow tumour growth and reduce hormone production. Over time, the majority of patients will experience tumour growth despite treatment with SSA therapy. When this occurs, the addition of Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT, a type of targeted radiotherapy) in combination with ongoing SSA therapy is given. However, it is not known if continuing SSA therapy after commencement of PRRT is beneficial or not.

In order to reduce the number of venepunctures, totally implanted venous access devices (TIVAD) or Ports have been used to administer antibiotics and other infusions.

The use of Port systems has been increasing in recent years, especially for those patients requiring frequent intravenous treatments.

One area that holds great promise for the development of novel, effective therapies is noninvasive brain stimulation. The investigators have used one form of brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), for some time to modulate and enhance cognitive function in the brain, especially working memory (WM) function, which has a central role in most executive processing that occurs in the brain. Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a paradigm of TMS which has been shown to effectively modulate WM. Moreover, TBS can modulate gamma neural oscillations in the brain and neural activity, both of which have been implicated in the physiology of WM and pathophysiology of the disease process in schizophrenia, making these measures highly valuable for assessing physiological effects of TBS on cognition, quality of life and cortical inhibition. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of TBS on WM in patients with schizophrenia, to develop evidence for potential brain stimulation techniques to treat cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.

Study activities and population group: Study subjects will be inpatient schizophrenic individuals with minimal positive symptoms and predominant cognitive deficits at Duke University Hospital. In an initial session they will be screened and taught a WM task. Following this, one TBS session will follow in which TBS will target dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. They will perform the WM task before, with and after the TBS, with an expected pre-post enhancement of WM performance.

Implications - There is a great need for treatments for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. The results of this study will serve to generate pilot data for a much larger grant to develop a TBS therapy for remediating such cognitive deficits.",6,* Patients aged 18-65 years of age with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder * No other mental health diagnoses * Right handed males and females * May have mild positive symptoms (score of \</= 21) * May have negative symptoms * Ability to provide informed consent * No restriction on concomitant medications given,* Intellectual disability * Any organic brain illness Presence of dementia symptoms or traumatic brain injury Primary diagnosis of substance use Seizure disorder Actively symptomatic with PANSS positive symptom sub-scale \>21.

This abnormal growth can lead to a variety of reproductive issues, including a higher risk of miscarriage and early pregnancy loss.

While there are treatments available for adenomyosis, they are often limited due to the lack of precise diagnostic criteria. One common approach is the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa), which can improve pregnancy rates in infertile women with adenomyosis. However, it's important to note that GnRHa may not restore pregnancy rates to baseline levels.

Another potential treatment option is the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS). This device releases a hormone called levonorgestrel into the uterus, which can help control the symptoms of endometriosis and adenomyosis.

Exercise improves several disease outcomes, like cardiovascular and neuromuscular functions and walking abilities. However, its disease modifying potential is poorly explored. Exercise might target two relevant disease hallmarks that are interconnected, such as the dysregulated immune system and the inflammatory synaptopathy. Exercise might act through the activation of the autonomic part of the vagus nerve, which is an important modulator of both the innate and adaptive immune system, through the so-called cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway-CAP.

This study aims to address the effect of exercise in reducing peripheral inflammation that drives the synaptic pathology and neurodegeneration occurring in the brain of MS patients. Patients will undergo a therapeutic exercise program, consisting of 3 hours of treatment per day, 6 days/week for a total of 6 weeks. The treatment will include both passive and active therapeutic exercises targeted to restore or preserve muscular flexibility, motor coordination and ambulatory function.

Patients with stage III and IV NSCLC are at risk of having their cancer spread from where it first started to the brain (metastatic). Because of this, more effective prognostic tools are necessary to determine which stage III and IV NSCLC patients are more likely to develop brain metastases. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could be a reliable source of ctDNA to confirm and predict the presence of brain metastases in these patients. Assessing cell free DNA shed from tumor cells could be a sensitive and minimally invasive way to detect or characterize metastatic tumors in the central nervous system (CNS). Lumbar puncture is procedure in which a thin needle called a spinal needle is put into the lower part of the spinal column to collect CSF. Lumbar punctures for the collection of CSF may help doctors detect or measure changes in cell types, genes, and proteins of circulating tumor cells related to lung cancer that will help determine the presence of brain metastases which could become a standard of care screening tool utilized in the follow-up of patients diagnosed with stage II or IV NSCLC.",40,"* New histological diagnosis of stage III or IV NSCLC * For stage III/IV NSCLC patients without brain metastases, a documented mutation on lung cancer mutation panel (PULMOL) is required * Patient treated with radiation therapy and/or systemic therapy at Ohio State University * Estimated survival \>= 1 year * No medical contraindication to lumbar puncture","* Patient has Alzheimer's, dementia, or mental disability * Patient is not able to receive MRI * Patient has allergy to xylocaine or any numbing medication for lumbar puncture * Previous cancer history prior to diagnosis of NSCLC",False,ALL,N/A,N/A,CHILD; ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,United States,The Ohio State Comprehensive Cancer Center,CONTACT,800-293-5066,OSUCCCClinicaltrials@osumc.edu,Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center,N/A

Background:

* Parents and families of children with chronic illnesses have stressors, including financial stress, role strains, separations, and interruptions in daily routines and plans for the future. All of these experiences may lead directly and indirectly to parental stress.
* The number of families headed by single or lone parents is increasing. Little work has been done to better understand if the needs of parents who are providing care for a child on their own differ from parents who do not classify themselves as lone. Identifying parents who may need additional support within a pediatric oncology setting is very important so that appropriate support is provided.

Objectives:

- To better understand the social, emotional, and practical effects of lone parents on children with cancer.

Eligibility:

* All parents whose child has been diagnosed with cancer between 6 and 18 months before enrolling on the study.
* Participants must be able to speak and read English

Design:

* Parents will be asked to complete a questionnaire during one of their child s clinic or hospital visits.

France has also been heavily impacted, with over 39.8 million infections and 167,000 deaths.

SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes an upper respiratory tract infection transmitted through the air. When it reaches the lungs, it leads to a severe acute respiratory illness called COVID-19. The body's response to this viral assault primarily occurs at the level of the respiratory mucosa.

This mucosal response is complex, involving various levels of activity. Mucosal immunity is therefore essential for an adequate and long-term immune response against viral respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 triggers a humoral immune response with the production of antibodies in the blood (serum antibodies) and antibodies in the upper respiratory tract (mucosal antibodies). It also induces a cellular immune response by activating specific blood T lymphocytes.

Tests used to measure the humoral blood response against SARS-CoV-2 and their neutralizing capacity are now well identified, as are tests for assessing the serum cellular T lymphocyte response. However, tests for measuring mucosal immune responses are not routinely used.

Our study aims to develop and qualify methods for analyzing mucosal immunity directed against SARS-CoV-2. These methods will be essential for a more precise analysis of the body's mucosal response to this virus.

Once these analytical methods are validated, they will enable the study of mucosal responses to infection, as well as mucosal responses induced by vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, particularly in the context of future nasal vaccine use.",240,* ≥18 years old * Participant affiliated with a social security scheme * Participant willing to take part in the study and having provided consent * Participant in good health or with a stable chronic condition for more than 6 months,"* Contraindication for nasopharyngeal sampling * Pregnant or breastfeeding women * Participants benefiting from a legal protection measure as referred to in articles L1121-5 to L1121-8 of the Public Health Code (guardianship, trusteeship, etc.) * Participant with an acute condition unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 infection * Participant with an unstable chronic condition",True,ALL,18 Years,100 Years,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,France,"Zoha MAAKAROUN-VERMESSE, MD-PHD",CONTACT,0247476972,z.maakaroun-vermesse@chu-tours.fr,"University Hospital, Tours",N/A

Discharge from a heart failure hospitalization is followed by a 30 day readmission rate of ≈24%. Readmissions for heart failure are typically preceded by a gradual rise in ventricular filling pressures that begins days or weeks before any detectable changes in clinical status.

Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a tool that is easily available at bedside and shows superior sensitivity for the detection of pulmonary congestion when compared with X ray or physical examination, even in the absence of symptoms.

Pulmonary congestion assessed by LUS identifies a subgroup with worse prognosis and a higher rate of readmission and mortality. Whether the implementation of lung ultrasound in the follow up of heart failure patients may reduce the rate of readmissions is unknown.

Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate a protocol of lung ultrasound guided therapy to prevent readmissions in heart failure outpatients.

Study design: the design of the investigator's study is a single center, single blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial.

Eligibility criteria: patients older than 18 years of age, who have been hospitalized for an acute heart failure syndrome. Exclusion criteria are life expectancy of less than 6 months, a surgically correctable cause of heart failure or uninterpretable lung ultrasound.

Eligible patients will be randomized into either ""LUS-guided therapy group"" or ""control group"" at hospital discharge. Follow-up visits will be scheduled at 15 days, 45 days, 3 months and 6 months after hospital discharge. LUS will be performed in all patients at hospital discharge and in every follow-up visit, but only in those allocated to the ""LUS-guided therapy group"" the information will be provided to the treating physician.

In the ""LUS-guided therapy group"", a prespecified diuretic dose will be administered to patients depending on the degree of ultrasonographic pulmonary congestion: if congestive (3 or more B lines, in total) a high dose (80-120mg furosemide PO/day) will be prescribed; if no congestive (less than 3 B lines, in total) a low dose (up to 40mg PO/day) will be prescribed.

In spite of the substantial advances in our understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis and prevention it remains one of the most common complications in conventional abdominal surgery with an incidence in the literature between 4% and 17%. As it is known that surgical sutures potentiate the development of wound infection the search for an ideal suture material, suitable for all purposes has been pursued by surgeons for decades.

Hypothesis: In line with in-vitro results the investigators hypothesize that the use of antibacterial skin sutures with triclosan poliglecaprone 25 reduces the rate of SSI after open abdominal surgery Methods: To prevent microbial colonization of suture material in operative wounds and therefore to prevent SSI, triclosan-coated poliglecaprone 25 suture materials with antibacterial activity will be tested against un-coated suture material for skin closure after open abdominal surgery of 200 patients. The study is planed as a single center, randomized controlled trial. After ethical approval the patients will be consecutively enrolled from 2011 to 2012 in the Department of Visceral Surgery, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. The patients will be followed for 30 days (day 3,7 and 30) to detect and document wound complications. Wound complications will be classified according to Center for Disease Control and Prevention Standard guidelines. Data will be collected and the rate of SSI will be analysed in both groups.

Expected value of the proposed project: If the investigators can confirm the proposed hypothesis in our study this could be a promising and feasible approach to lower SSI after open abdominal surgery and might be also used in other surgical fields. By lowering the rate of SSI the investigators might offer a new and cost saving procedure to the surgical community.",52,* All patients from the Visceral Department of Basel University Hospital requiring open abdominal surgery.

People with lumbar spinal stenosis may be at increased risk of obesity given walking limitations. Spinal stenosis is a very common degenerative condition in people over 45.

Objective: The objective of this project is test a new e-health (online) pedometer and nutrition intervention aimed at promoting weight loss and increasing physical activity in overweight and obese individuals with spinal stenosis. Methods: The investigators will recruit 88 people with lumbar spinal stenosis who are overweight or obese.

With the current three-week on and one week off schedule, a significant number of patients develop grade 3 or higher degree of neutropenia and require dose reduction and sometimes discontinuation. This potentially compromises the efficacy of the drug. In addition, as the half-life of palbociclib is 27 hours, 1 week break with the standard 3 weeks on and 1 week off dosing schedule could potentially lead to recovery of Rb phosphorylation during the off week. Hence, the investigators propose a 5 days on and 2 days off schedule each week without any weeks off drug. Although the cumulative doses each 28-day cycle is roughly the same with this schedule compared to conventional dosing, the bone marrow is not exposed to the drug continuously for 21 days and rather gets frequent breaks from therapy. The investigators hypothesize that the 5 days on and 2 days off schedule is more tolerable with less frequent high grade neutropenia and dose interruption/reduction. In addition, this schedule also provides for a more continuous drug delivery to the patient since there is not a week's break in therapy, which could ultimately prove to be more efficacious.",55,"* Histologically confirmed metastatic ER+ and/or PR+ and HER2- breast cancer who are candidates for palbociclib in combination with either letrozole or fulvestrant per treating physician. * Presence of measurable or non-measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria. * One prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting is allowed, but patients who have not had any prior systemic therapies in the metastatic setting are also eligible. * At least 18 years of age. * Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2 * Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below: * Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl * Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl * Total bilirubin ≤ institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) or total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x IULN with direct bilirubin within normal range in patients with documented Gilbert's syndrome * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 1.5 x IULN (up to 5 x IULN in patients with liver disease) * Creatinine ≤ IULN OR creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with serum creatinine levels above institutional normal (calculated by Creatinine Clearance Estimate by Cockcroft-Gault Equation) * Pre- or post-menopausal women are allowed.

Chronic inflammation, as measured by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, is frequently seen in these patients and contributes to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in this population.

Sertraline, a widely used antidepressant, is effective in treating depression in hemodialysis patients and has been suggested to have anti-inflammatory properties. This study aims to evaluate whether sertraline can reduce inflammation, as measured by CRP levels, in hemodialysis patients diagnosed with depression.

This research is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at Nishtar Hospital, Multan. A total of 62 adult hemodialysis patients with depression will be enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either sertraline or a placebo for 12 weeks.

Depression severity will be assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), a widely used tool for measuring the severity of depressive symptoms. HAM-D scores will be recorded at baseline, at weeks 4, 8, and 12 to evaluate changes in depressive symptoms over time.

CRP levels will also be measured at baseline and after 12 weeks to determine whether sertraline reduces systemic inflammation in these patients.

The hypothesis of this study is that sertraline treatment will significantly lower CRP levels compared to a placebo, potentially providing dual benefits-improving mood and reducing inflammation-related health risks in hemodialysis patients.

Microcirculatory disorders and tissue fibrosis are excessive severity of the disease. This condition can affect the hands with a major functional consequence severely impairing the quality of life of patients.

Adipose tissue is used in plastic surgery for over a century for the filling of depressions in the skin. In addition to the volume effect, a trophic effect on the surrounding tissue was noted. It is shown that the stromal vascular fraction is responsible for this regenerative effect.

In a previous study the investigators have demonstrated in a mouse model that the subcutaneous adipose tissue provides a trophic effect on SSc skin lesions by reducing the fibrosis of the dermis and providing a pro angiogenic.

Objectives and means:

This is a clinical study evaluating an innovative cell therapy procedure. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of injection of autologous stromal vascular fraction of adipose origin according to the system Celution ® (Cytori Therapeutics, Inc.., United Kingdom) in digital in patients with scleroderma cutaneous hands.

Eleven patients with scleroderma with the hands will be included in the study. Due to the nature of the orphan disease, a longitudinal study be conducted, where each patient will have own control.

The evaluation will be pre and post operative for a period of six months. This evaluation will be based on clinical criteria (trophic balance, functional) and laboratory (capillaroscopy, Doppler ultrasound of the arteries of the forearm, laser-Doppler tissue).

Project schedule and implementation phases:

The project will run over a period of twelve months. Patients will be followed for a period of six months. Analyzes clinical, paraclinical, and exploitation of results will be achieved over a period of six months.

Expected Results: This study will validate the functional and trophic effects of reinjection of autologous stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue issue on the fingers of patients with scleroderma.

Several hypothesis can be evocated : Gram negative bacterial systemic spreading, inflammatory transmitter substance systemic spreading (IL1, IL6, IL17, PGE2), systemic spreading of bacterial degradation products (LPS for example).

Currently Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG) might be a susceptibility factor to RA because PG has an enzyme, the peptidylarginine deiminase leading to auto antibodies creation and RA increasing. As periodontitis, RA is chronic disease with a cyclic increase evolution, needing a complex pluridisciplinary treatment approach. Recent studies have reported an increased prevalence of RA patients with periodontal disease. Others studies show that periodontal treatment induces a significant decrease of the sedimentation rate and of the DAS28. Periodontitis is suspected to be an independent, aggravating factor in patients with RA (given the definition from NIH : an aggravating factor is something that makes a condition worse). So periodontal treatment cannot be considered as a RA treatment per se. But it is hypothesised that treating periodontitis in RA patients showing signs of periodontitis could result in improvement in RA disease activity. To date the role of periodontitis as an aggravating factor in these patients remains unclear, and only RCT designs can reasonably be used to test this causal hypothesis. There still remains some RA patients who have persistent symptoms and frequent exacerbations despite specialist care and continuous treatment, so results of treating aggravating factors are needed. As the majority of patients will benefit from a systematic evaluation and treatment of aggravating factors, the periodontal treatment strategy need to be tested.

The aim of this randomised controlled trial is to assess the effectiveness of periodontal treatment for rheumatoid arthritis patients.

It involves an intense inflammatory response in the lungs, leading to endothelial damage, increased capillary permeability, and fluid accumulation, causing hypoxemia and respiratory failure. ARDS can result from various pulmonary and non-pulmonary triggers.

The 2012 Berlin criteria are widely used to diagnose ARDS, based on clinical signs, blood gas analysis, and chest imaging. The Lung Injury Prediction Score (LIPS) is used in emergency departments to assess the risk of ARDS, with scores of 4 or higher indicating a significant risk. Oxygenation impairment, particularly measured by the S/F ratio (oxygen saturation to inspired oxygen), is a strong predictor of ARDS. Common causes of death include severe hypoxemia, sepsis, organ failure, and respiratory complications.

ARDS treatment emphasizes supportive care, including lung-protective ventilation, prone positioning, and conservative fluid management. Pharmacological approaches have shown mixed results, with treatments like statins, surfactants, anticoagulants, and β2-agonists (e.g., salbutamol) offering inconsistent benefits.

Corticosteroids have demonstrated improvements in oxygenation in conditions that progress to ARDS. Inhaled corticosteroids are being explored to minimize systemic side effects by targeting the lungs directly. Ipratropium bromide, an inhaled bronchodilator, may also offer therapeutic benefits by reducing lung inflammation and pulmonary edema. However, it carries risks such as dry mouth, blurred vision, and potential cardiovascular side effects.

This double-blinded randomized controlled trial examines the effectiveness of early inhaled corticosteroids and ipratropium in reducing the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and its complications in high-risk patients. Participants will be administered aerosolized budesonide and ipratropium or a placebo every eight hours for five days.

In this study, the investigators aim to assess the feasibility and patient acceptability of establishing speech with an Electrolarynx for intubated or tracheostomized patients experiencing difficult weaning and unable to tolerate cuff deflation. Feasibility will be determined by the proportion of participants able to produce intelligible and comprehensible speech. The investigators will also collect data on consent rates, reasons for refusal, the proportion of eligible patients and the time required for research procedures to inform future studies. The investigators will provide participants with a maximum of five Electrolarynx training sessions. On completion the investigators will measure speech intelligibility, comprehensibility, and patient acceptability using the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech and the Ease of Communication scale. Satisfaction with communication and anxiety will be measured before and after Electrolarynx training. To the investigators' knowledge, this study will be the first to rigorously evaluate, using previously validated measures, the feasibility of the Electrolarynx for establishing communication for mechanically ventilated patients.",24,N/A,N/A,False,ALL,18 Years,100 Years,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,Canada,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Michael Garron Hospital,OTHER

The causes of CNLBP are still not fully elucidated and there is currently no gold standard treatment for CNLBP. The mainstay of conservative treatment for CNLBP includes pharmacological interventions, weight loss and physiotherapy.

More recently, Tuina, a component of Traditional Chinese Medicine, has been used to treat CNLBP as well. Tuina is mainly applied to the meridians or acupoints by manipulation techniques such as pushing, grasping, pressing and rubbing of the soft tissues or muscles of the body. It is reported to improve circulation and the qi in the body. However, recent systematic reviews on the efficacy of Tuina in the management of CNLBP were not able to definitively conclude the effectiveness of Tuina due to the poor methodological quality of the studies.

Therefore, this study is a single blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT), which aims to determine the efficacy and safety of Tuina in the management of CNLBP. Similar studies are also conducted in China (First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University) and USA (Mayo Clinic).

Patients from SGH Orthopaedic clinics with CNLBP, will be recruited for this RCT, and will be randomly divided into 3 intervention groups: Physiotherapy intervention group as the control group, Tuina intervention group, and combined intervention (Tuina + Physiotherapy) group. The intervention will last for 2 months, and follow up assessments will be conducted at the 5th month.

PCOS is also associated with increased risk of abnormal lipoproteins and hypertension, as well as cardiovascular or cerebrovascular morbidity (3). The lipid and lipoprotein profile in androgenized women with poly cystic ovaries is similar to the made pattern with higher levels of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and this abnormal pattern is independent of body weight (4). Insulin resistance is associated with reproductive abnormalities in women with PCOS. Improving insulin sensitivity through both lifestyle and pharmacological intervention can ameliorate these abnormalities. Insulin resistance in women with PCOS is common (up to 50%), both in obese and nonobese women (5), and disordered insulin action precedes the increase in androgen.

Treatment for PCOS subjects typically includes, implementation of lifestyle changes especially weight loss and adjuvant pharmaceutical intervention including oral contraceptives, anti-androgen therapy and insulin-lowering drugs (such as, metformin) (6). Metformin is a biguanide used extensively in type 2 diabetes. It inhibits hepatic glucose production and increases peripheral insulin sensitivity, but dose not cause hypoglycemia. Several studies have shown an increase in insulin sensitivity and pregnancy rate accompanied by decreased insulin and androgen levels in PCOS patients taking metformin (7).

The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-COA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis, and inhibition of this enzyme decreases cholesterol synthesis and a compensatory increase in the expression of LDL receptors in the liver. Statins reduce plasma triglycerides in dose-dependent fashion and also have a modest HDL-raising effect which is not dose-dependent (8,9). Furthermore, statins pose other cardio-protective properties, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions (10,11).

Some studies have reported that simvastatin decreases serum androgen levels in women with PCOS (12,13) by inhibiting proliferation and steroidogenesis of ovarian theca-interstitial cells (14). According to these previous findings, we hypothesized that combination therapy with simvastatin and metformin will result in lower androgen levels and cardiovascular risk factors in women with PCOS.",84,"* All patients should have at least two of three following criteria: I) chronic anovulation, II) clinical and/or biochemical evidence of androgen excess and III) polycystic-appearing ovaries on transvaginal ultrasound.","* Patients with Cushing's syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), thyroid disease, adrenal hyperplasia and androgen-secreting tumors or other endocrinopathies, will be excluded from the study. * Patients with adrenal hyperplasia will be excluded by ACTH-stimulated 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels less than 10 ng/ml (15), and ACTH-stimulated 11-deoxycortisol levels less than 21 ng/ml \[3-fold the 95th percentile (16) of a historical control group of 60 healthy women controls\]. * Those subjects who have kidney or liver diseases and those who were smoker or had breast cancer will also be excluded from the study. * None of the participants receive oral contraceptives (OCPs), steroid hormones or any medications that interfere with lipid metabolism, ovarian and pituitary and hypothalamic function, or insulin sensitivity in the last 3 months before study.",False,FEMALE,16 Years,45 Years,CHILD; ADULT,"Iran, Islamic Republic of",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Fasa University of Medical Sciences,OTHER

Body weight and shape dissatisfaction is linked to the development, maintenance and relapse of AN. Neuroimaging studies have shown that the inferior parietal cortex is involved in body image perception and less activated in patients with AN compared with healthy subjects. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is used to modulate cortical excitability, and particularly to increase excitability with high-frequency rTMS. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ""excitatory"" high-frequency rTMS over the ""hypoactive"" inferior parietal cortex of 54 patients with AN.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will compare effective rTMS (2000 ten-Hz stimulations per session, applied at 90% of the resting motor threshold, with 10 sessions in two weeks) versus placebo rTMS.

Assessments will be performed before rTMS and after the last rTMS session (immediately after, at 15 days and three months). The principal criteria for judgement is a body image satisfaction scale (Boby Shape Questionnaire, BSQ-34). The secondary criteria for judgement are eating behaviour scales (Eating Attitude Test, EAT-40; Bulimia test, BULIT and Eating Disorders Inventory, EDI-2), the Hamilton depression rating scale and Hamilton anxiety rating scale, a quality of life scale (Short-Form Health Survey, SF-36), a body composition analysis using a Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and the alpha-MSH autoantibodies levels (biomarker for eating disorders recently described).

Inferior parietal cortex rTMS could not only improve body image perception, but also help in the treatment of eating disorders, allowing weight gain with a decreased anxiety and improving patients' quality of life.

""Investigational"" means that sulindac is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved the use of sulindac for your type of cancer.

Participants in this study must have undergone previous chemotherapy and achieved complete remission, which is the absence of disease activity in people with a chronic illness, in this case AML. Unfortunately, a significant number of patients with AML who achieve a complete remission with initial chemotherapy eventually experience a relapse, often within a few months.

Previous research studies have demonstrated that a type of medication frequently used to treat inflammation, called a COX inhibitor, may suppress and kill leukemia cells. COX inhibitors work by blocking a class of proteins called COX proteins. Other commonly used COX inhibitors are ibuprofen and naproxen.

Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) is a multidisciplinary care model designed to optimize perioperative management through standardized protocols.

For gynecological surgery, ERAS emphasizes preoperative education, early interventions (e.g., smoking cessation, anemia management, nutrition optimization), intraoperative strategies (e.g., fluid balance, nausea prevention, temperature control), and postoperative care (e.g., early mobilization, pain control, ileus prevention). However, while ERAS is gaining acceptance, its effectiveness can vary due to workload, patient variability, and institutional resources, and its superiority over traditional care remains inconclusive.

This study aims to objectively compare ERAS and traditional perioperative care using the QoR-15 questionnaire to assess patient satisfaction, recovery speed, surgical risk reduction, and complication prevention.

It has been well established that development of chronic pain is related to experienced pain in the perioperative period. This study therefore aims to assess if both acute and chronic post-operative mastectomy pain can be better managed by a novel regional anesthesia nerve block known as the pectoralis block (PECs). The PECs block is easier for patients to position for placement, has less risk of harm to nearby structures, and less risk for systemic uptake of local anesthetic in comparison to the paravertebral block. The PECs block has a strong safety profile. Standard of care at University of Wisconsin (UW) hospital is to utilize regional anesthesia for post op pain management.

Cervical cancer is still the major health problem in the developing countries. It has been the first rank women's cancer in Thailand for many decades. Approximately 10-20% of Thai women have the high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) infections in their cervices. This will frequently lead to low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) (10%), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) (0.8%), and finally, cervical cancers (0.16%) within 10-20 years. The treatment options for LSILs are either observation or ablative surgery. However, in our institute, cryotherapy, which is the one of ablative surgery, is more frequently used to comfort our women. It is not only effective but safe with only minimal side effects; watery leukorrhea for 2-4 weeks, and local cervical infection not more than 1%. Contraindication to this procedure are active cervical infection, lesion of 2 mm-larger than probe, lesion inside cervical os and suspected cervical cancer. Additionally, in developing countries such as Thailand, this treatment is safe, acceptable, feasible and effective. Patients with LSILs could also have this treatment in some rural area from the 10-days trained nurses. Fortunately, recent reports showed that cryotherapy has abilities not only in clearing LSILs but also clearing the HPV infections, its necessary cause. However, there are no randomized controlled trial compared its clearing ability between observation and cryotherapy. Therefore, a randomized controlled trial is needed to demonstrate that.

There are multiple factors contributing to clopidogrel response variability, including genetic variations of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 enzyme. In particular, loss-of-function (LOF) alleles of the CYP2C19 enzyme reduce transformation of clopidogrel pro-drug into its active metabolite. Thus, patients carrying LOF alleles have lower levels of clopidogrel's active metabolite as well as diminished platelet inhibition, which translates into an increased rate of adverse cardiovascular events, particularly in the setting of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Prasugrel and ticagrelor are novel generation P2Y12 receptor inhibitors characterized by greater PD potency and reduced ischemic event rates compared with clopidogrel, and are not affected by CYP2C19 LOF polymorphisms. However, to date there are limited head-to-head PD comparisons between these two new P2Y12 receptors blockers, and there are no studies assessing on how these agents behave among CYP2C19 LOF carriers.

2. Control Arm: paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) implantation as per standard practice.

Eligible subjects with coronary artery disease in a small vessel (reference diameter\<2.8mm) will be consecutively screened and enrolled based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria

1. The means of LLL in the 2 groups are precisely equal
2. A standard deviation in LLL of 0.5mm in both groups as demonstrated in the ISAR-SMART 3 and PEPCAD II trials
3. A non-inferiority margin of 0.25mm between groups is clinically unimportant

A urine-based test was recently developed, called UTRA (urine tenofovir rapid assay). This test can give clinic staff immediate results about a person's adherence to the antiretroviral medication Tenofovir (TDF). The study will compare the results of this urine test to drug levels found in blood, self-reported adherence and pharmacy collection records to see if this test can be used as part of routine care in ART clinics. If the test is effective it would allow clinic staff to identify people with adherence difficulties early and give them the necessary support before their viral load rises.",200,"* ≥18 years old * Willing and able to provide written informed consent * HIV-infected, receiving or (re-)starting a tenofovir-based ART regimen * Current ART regimen includes at least one drug with a high genetic barrier to resistance e.g. dolutegravir, atazanavir/ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir. * Any previous raised viral load \>50 copies/ml (after ART initiation). * Willing and able to comply with laboratory tests and other study procedures",* Not willing or able to provide informed consent in any of the languages provided * Not receiving a tenofovir-based ART regimen * Any other clinical condition that in the opinion of an investigator puts the patient at increased risk if participating in the study.,False,ALL,18 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,South Africa,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"University of California, San Francisco",OTHER

The purpose of this research study is to examine effects of dry needling on the nervous system (pathways between the muscle, spinal cord, and brain) in people with spasticity due to chronic stroke. Dry needling is a procedure in which a thin, stainless steel needle is inserted into your skin to produce a muscle twitch response. It is intended to release a knot in your muscle and relieve pain.

The total study duration is 2 days. The first visit will take about 3 hours, during which dry needling will take place, and the second visit will take about 1 hour.

Secondary objectives include determining if the intervention is associated with a reduction in emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations due to a fall, and examining five implementation outcomes: appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, penetration, and equity.

This study is a pragmatic cluster-randomized trial to test the effectiveness of a primary care clinician value champion for de-implementing PIMs among patients 65 years of age and older with a diagnosis of dementia. Medicare Part D pharmacy claims data will be analyzed at the end of the 12-month intervention for the primary outcome, the medication possession rates (MPR) for three groups of potentially inappropriate medications: antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, and hypoglycemic medications (sulfonylureas and insulin). In a similar fashion, a hospital admission, or an emergency department visit for a fall will be assessed at the end of the intervention using Medicare claims data. Finally, the five implementation outcomes will be evaluated at the end of the intervention from notes entered by the value champions in project workbooks.

Primary care clinics within each of the two participating ACOs will be randomized to either the intervention or control arms of the study. Prior to random assignment, the investigators will stratify practices based on high versus low historic prescribing rates. A primary care clinician from each clinic selected for the trial in the intervention arm (n=30 across the two ACOs) will be recruited as a clinician value champion for each intervention clinic. The clinician value champion will participate in twice monthly value champion web-based training sessions for six months and then launch a 12-month initiative within the clinician value champions' clinics to reduce PIM prescribing among PLWD. Study outcomes will be assessed 12 months after the clinician value champions launch the initiative.

After the introduction of silastic catheters in the 1970's this method became the treatment of choice for children and adults with communicating hydrocephalus. The average patient necessitating VPS will undergo at least two shunt revisions every three years, with some patients requiring more than twenty revisions within the first year. Therefore, any technical improvement with a positive impact on the revision rate not only benefits the patient through a reduction of the surgical burden but may also have economic advantages.

Distal shunt failures - either due to improper placement or secondary dislocation of the distal catheter out of the peritoneal cavity - have been reported in 10-30% of cases. Catheter placement in obese patients and in patients with adhesions owing to previous abdominal surgery remains challenging. Most neurosurgeons will carry out a mini-laparotomy to allow for the placement of the distal catheter end within the peritoneal cavity, which rarely requires the help of a general or visceral surgeon.

An alternative to laparotomy is the laparoscopic placement of the peritoneal catheter in VPS. Retrospective series have since shown the safety of this procedure and suggested an advantage of laparoscopic VPS in terms of operation duration, length of hospital stay and the rate of distal (and thus potentially overall) shunt dysfunction.

The evidence concerning the effect of laparoscopic surgery for VPS placement is so far based on non-randomized studies, in which a selection bias may have influenced the outcomes.",120,* Age 18 years or older * newly diagnosed hydrocephalus needing VP Shunt according to a board certified neurosurgeon * Patients with shunt-malfunction needing VP Shunt revision and replacement of the peritoneal catheter * Written Informed Consent,* Age younger than 18 years * Pregnancy,False,ALL,18 Years,N/A,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,Switzerland,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Insel Gruppe AG, University Hospital Bern",OTHER

Furthermore, SAIT301 also induces efficient c-MET internalization from the cell surface and subsequent degradation, resulting in inhibition of growth of the c-MET addicted cancer cells.
