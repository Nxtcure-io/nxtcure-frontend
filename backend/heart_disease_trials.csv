This study plan utilizes myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) to explore a) the effects of acute hyperglycemia on myocardial perfusion and coronary flow reserve in individuals with and without DM; and b) the effects of GLP-1 on myocardial perfusion and coronary flow reserve during euglycemia and hyperglycemia in DM. The investigators will recruit individuals with and without DM matched for age, gender and degree of obesity. The investigators will measure myocardial perfusion at rest and during vasodilator stress (to ascertain coronary flow reserve) while subjects are under controlled pancreatic clamp conditions during euglycemia (glucose \~100 mg/dl) and hyperglycemia (glucose \~250 mg/dl) in the presence and absence of concomitant GLP-1 infusion. The investigators believe that the translational significance of their studies is immense, impacting upon both acute and chronic cardiovascular disease manifestations. The effect of glycemic control on cardiovascular outcomes, morbidity and mortality remains an area of active investigation, fueled by the recent conflicting results of several large clinical trials (ACCORD, United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), ADVANCE, VADT). If the investigators find that hyperglycemia is associated with altered myocardial perfusion, the mechanistic implications in the prevention and management of acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases in DM will be groundbreaking. Furthermore, if GLP-1 augments myocardial perfusion (as it does in the peripheral vasculature), the therapeutic benefits for prevention of cardiovascular events in this predisposed population are clear.",33,"* Males and females * Age 40-60 years * BMI\< or = 35 kg/m2 * Diabetic subjects with HbA1c concentrations of \< or = 8%. * Diabetic subjects will be either on diet and lifestyle therapy alone, or monotherapy with metformin or sulphonylureas (except glyburide). * All diabetic subjects should be on stable dose oral agent therapy for 3 months prior to enrollment.","* Subjects with cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease. * Subjects with suspected or overt autonomic neuropathy. * Diabetic subject on thiazolidinediones, insulin, GLP-1 based therapies (exenatide or sitagliptin), alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, glyburide or combination antidiabetic drug therapies. * Diabetics with microalbuminuria.",True,ALL,40 Years,60 Years,ADULT,United States

NCT04065165,Lanreotide Combined With Telotristat Ethyl or Placebo for the First-line Treatment in Patients With Advanced Well Differentiated Small Intestinal Neuroendocrine Tumours (siNET) With Highly-functioning Carcinoid Syndrome,Randomized Phase III Clinical Trial of Lanreotide Combined With Telotristat Ethyl or Placebo for the First-line Treatment in Patients With Advanced Well Differentiated Small Intestinal Neuroendocrine Tumours (siNET) With Highly-functioning Carcinoid Syndrome,WITHDRAWN,2020-04,2027-10,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,Small Intestinal NET; Carcinoid Heart Disease,Telotristat Ethyl; Lanreotide,Number of bowel movements (BMs),"This is a randomized phase III clinical trial of Lanreotide combined with Telotristat ethyl or placebo for the first-line treatment in patients with advanced well differentiated small intestinal neuroendocrine tumours (siNET) with highly-functioning carcinoid syndrome to test whether telotristat ethyl plus lanreotide is more effective than placebo plus lanreotide in reducing the number of daily bowel movements.

In addition, the study allows evaluation of the biochemical response (5-HIAA and chromogranin-A), the reduction in the number of daily cutaneous flushing episodes, the improvement in abdominal pain/discomfort, health-related quality of life, improvement in gastro-intestinal and endocrine symptoms, changes in emotional functioning, the impact of discontinuation of telotristat ethyl/placebo on HRQOL and symptoms, and the safety and toxicity of the treatment.

Patients will enter into a screening/run-in period of 1 week to establish baseline characteristics and symptomatology. The baseline assessment of daily bowel movement, as assessed in an electronic diary, will be averaged over the run-in period.

Following the screening/run-in period, patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either the control arm or the experimental arm for 12 months. Randomization will be stratified according to the grade of tumour differentiation (grade 1 vs. grade 2) and by baseline number of bowel movements per day (4-6 versus \>6). A total of 94 patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either arm.

Upon randomization, all patients will enter the 12-month treatment period with lanreotide + telotristat ethyl/placebo (blinded). In the experimental arm, patients will receive the deep subcutaneous injection of lanreotide (120 mg) every 28 days and 250 mg orally three times daily (TID) of telotristat ethyl for 12 months. In the control arm, patients will receive the deep subcutaneous injection of lanreotide every 28 days (120 mg) and placebo orally TID for 12 months.

After completion of a minimum of 6 months on randomized blinded-treatment, the protocol allows for patients on treatment with telotristat ethyl/placebo to be unblinded in the event of ""lack of symptom control"". Unblinding due to ""lack of symptom control"" can happen at any time between 6 and 12 months of the blinded-treatment period. After unblinding, patient will interrupt protocol treatment and will be further treated as per clinician discretion.

All patients will be unblinded after a maximum of 12 months on randomized blinded-treatment.

After a follow-up of 12 months, patients will go off study except patients with carcinoid heart disease. Patients off study will be further treated as per clinician discretion.

Patients with carcinoid heart disease will continue open-label treatment on study (lanreotide + telotristat ethyl or lanreotide alone according to what they were receiving at unblinding at 12 months) for 4 additional years (open-label extension period). Patients with carcinoid heart disease who discontinue protocol treatment before 12 months will also enter the extension period for additional follow-up. Additional follow-up will last 4 years for these patients and will include 6-monthly cardiological assessments.

All efficacy analyses will be conducted in the Intention-to-treat population as primary analyses i.e. all 94 randomized patients will be analyzed in the arm they were allocated by randomization. Safety analyses will be performed on the Safety population i.e. on all patients who have received at least one dose of the study drugs.

The translational research projects include blood metabolite discovery and targeted assays to find new biomarker candidates of response to Telotristat.

Human biological material that will be collected for translational research purpose:

* whole blood, plasma and serum at baseline, 4 hours after first dose, 4 weeks, 12 weeks and at end of treatment visit with telotristat/placebo (due to end of study, disease progression or lack of benefit)
* archival tissue samples (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded) will be retrieved for all patients at study entry. In addition, one EDTA blood tube of whole blood (10 ml) at baseline, 12 weeks and end of treatment (EOT visit) might be also collected for not yet pre-defined and further translational research.

Quality of life will be assessed with the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) version 3, together with the QLQ-GI.NET21 specific module designed for Neuroendocrine Tumours. The computer-adaptive testing (CAT) diarrhea scale will also be used. The baseline questionnaires must be completed during the screening period and before randomization. Subsequent questionnaires are completed at 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks and 52 weeks.

In congenital long QT syndrome type 1 (LQT1), episodes of ventricular tachycardia are usually triggered by exercise and can be prevented in most patients by beta-blocker therapy. In addition, LQT1 associated with a normal resting QT interval can be unmasked by the abnormal QT response to exercise testing (failure of the QT interval to shorten normally). Preliminary data from our laboratory show that the exercise QT intervals of patients with LQT1 are partially normalized by beta-blocker therapy. It is still currently not known if beta-blockers modify the QT/heart rate relationship (a primary effect on repolarization) or if the ""normalizing"" effect is due to the inability of subjects on beta-blockers to attain sufficiently high workloads (due to reduced heart rate) for prolongation to occur. Moreover, the physiologic response of the exercise QT interval to beta-blockers in healthy control subjects is not known.

Objective. The objective of this study is to define the impact of beta-blocker therapy on the QT response to exercise and recovery in normal subjects.

Methods. Approximately 36 healthy adult subjects age-matched to previously studied LQT1 subjects will undergo 1) screening history, 2) two weeks of beta-blocker therapy ending in an exercise test, and 3) two weeks of placebo therapy ending in an exercise test. Beta blocker and placebo will be given in random order in a double-blind fashion. The QT response to exercise and recovery will be compared between drug-free and beta-blocker-treated states. These data will be compared to those previously collected for LQT1 subjects.

Implications. These results will provide new information about the effect of beta-blocker therapy on repolarization parameters in normal subjects, and will provide a context in which to interpret the previous findings that beta-blocker administration modifies the QT response to exercise in LQT1 subjects.",36,"* Healthy normal adults, age- and gender-matched to previously studied LQT1 subjects","* Cardiac disease * Diabetes * Hypertension * Severe allergic reaction * Asthma requiring treatment * Use of medications other than oral contraceptives, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or synthroid or other thyroid medications * Pregnancy (subjects will be asked if they are pregnant) * Inability to sign informed consent",True,ALL,18 Years,55 Years,ADULT,N/A

Malignant VTs involve an electrical ""short circuit"" in the heart, formed by narrow channels of surviving tissue inside myocardial scar. An important treatment is to use catheter ablation to ""block"" the channel that forms the circuit. Effective ablation requires imaging guidance to visualize the VT circuit relative to scar structures in 3D. Unfortunately, with conventional catheter mapping, up to 90% of the VT circuits are too short-lived to be mapped. For the 10% ""mappable"" VTs, their data are only available during ablation and limited to one ventricular surface. This inadequacy of functional VT data largely limits the knowledge about scar-related VT and ablation strategies, and reduces the ability of clinicians to identify ablation targets and assess ablation outcome.

The central hypothesis of this proposal is that functional VT data, integrated with CT or MRI scar data in 3D, can improve VT ablation efficacy with pre-procedural identification of ablation targets and post-procedural mechanistic elucidation of ablation failure. This research builds on the rapidly increasing clinical interest in electrocardiographic imaging (ECGi), an emerging technique that obtains cardiac electrical activity through inverse reconstructions from ECGs.

NCT01741766,The Effects of Stretching Training on Arterial Function and Autonomic Control,"The Effects of 8 Weeks of Stretching Training on Arterial Stiffness, Wave Reflection, Endothelial Function and Cardiac Autonomic Control.",COMPLETED,2011-05,2011-12,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,Obesity; Pre-hypertension; Hypertension,Stretching Training,Blood pressure,"Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Hypertension and abdominal obesity are associated with dysfunction of the main mechanisms of cardiovascular regulation, the autonomic nervous system and the vascular endothelium. Increased sympathetic activity and endothelial dysfunction are associated with increased arterial stiffness, which is an independent risk factor for the development of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. The recommended intervention for controlling BP in pre- and stage 1- hypertensive individuals is lifestyle modifications such as exercise, and not drug therapy.Although aerobic and resistance exercise has been shown to be beneficial for the cardiovascular system, special populations such as the elderly and obese may have physical and/or musculoskeletal limitations which may limit their participation in these exercise modalities.

Stretching is a form of exercise that is widely recommended for injury prevention. Among the benefits of stretching are an increased flexibility, enhanced muscular coordination, stress relief, improved range of motion and an improved posture. Previous studies have shown stretching training to increase arterial compliance and acutely increase sympathetic nerve activity. In addition, low flexibility levels have been found to be associated with arterial stiffness. Given that stretching of skeletal muscle causes an increase in sympathetic nerve activity; repetitive stimulation of sympathetic activity induced by habitual stretching, might chronically reduce resting sympathetic activity. The reduction in sympathetic activity might result in a decrease of arterial stiffness and blood pressure.

The investigators hypothesis is that 8 weeks of stretching training would reduce arterial stiffness, blood pressure and sympathetic activity in obese women. The investigators also hypothesize that the improved arterial function with stretching would be associated with increases in flexibility levels.",30,* 50-65 years old * Blood pressure between 121/81 and 159/99 mmHg * Body mass index of 25-39.9 * Sedentary or low active (less than 2 hr per wk),"* Younger than 50 or older than 65 years of age * Body mass index lower than 25, or 40 or higher * Physically active or competitively active * Smoker * Systolic blood pressure higher than 160 mmHg * Use of hormone replacement therapy of less than 1 yr * Use of calcium channel blocker or beta blockers * Type 1 diabetes * Type 2 diabetes * Known cardiovascular disease",True,ALL,50 Years,65 Years,ADULT; OLDER_ADULT,United States

NCT00437866,Hepcidin in Anemic Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) Patients,Hepcidin in the Pathogenesis of Anemia in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure,COMPLETED,2007-01,2010-07,OBSERVATIONAL,N/A,Anemia; Chronic Heart Failure,N/A,Hemodilution,"Background: Anemia in chronic heart failure (CHF) is directly linked to increased mortality and reduced exercise capacity. The pathomechanism for the development of anemia in CHF is not well understood. Impairment of iron homeostasis is discussed to be one of the major triggers in anemia of chronic disease. Hepcidin was recently described as the central regulator of iron homeostasis.

Main hypothesis: Plasma hepcidin levels are altered in anemic CHF patients compared to non anemic controls and might be a main contributing factor of anemia in CHF.

Iron regulator-hypothesis High levels of cytokines in CHF patients cause up-regulation of hepcidin, which in turn leads to low iron uptake causing anemia. In this case venous hepcidin and hemoglobin concentrations should both correlate with cytokine levels.

Erythropoietin regulator-hypothesis Dysregulation of the erythropoietin system results in anemia, which represses hepcidin. This leads to a negative correlation between hemoglobin and hepcidin in plasma.

Methods: 100 consecutive patients diagnosed with systolic CHF will be prospectively included in the study. Iron status will be assessed and hepcidin, erythropoietin as well as interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and soluble TNF alpha receptor levels will be measured by ELISA.

Patients will be followed up for one year and mortality, rehospitalization and worsening of CHF will be documented.",100,1. Systolic left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF\<45%) 2.

Hip and knee arthroplasty patients are also at risk of cardiovascular complications. Patients who have these complications have higher levels of inflammation postoperatively. Statins (such as atorvastatin/Lipitor) lower cholesterol and also lessen inflammation. Both of these effects are important in preventing heart attacks. Statins have been shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks in non-surgical patients, and to protect from heart attacks in patients having heart surgery. Whether statins can prevent heart attacks in orthopedic patients is not known.

In this pilot study the investigators will treat 30 orthopedic surgery patients (hip fracture, hip or knee arthroplasty) with either atorvastatin or placebo (a capsule with no study drug). Patients will start the study drug prior to surgery and take it for 45 days after surgery. Neither the doctors nor the patients will know whether they are taking atorvastatin or placebo. The investigators will look for evidence of inflammation and heart injury after surgery. The investigators hypothesize that atorvastatin will lessen the degree of postoperative inflammation found in these patients. In this study, the investigators will use a very sensitive test of heart injury that can detect problems even when patients have no symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that this test will demonstrate silent heart injury in over 50% of the hip fracture patients and over 30% of arthroplasty patients in our study.

The investigators aim to further the mechanistic understanding of atherothrombosis by studying the activation of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors in cardiovascular thrombus using the novel platelet radiotracer (18F-GP1). Binding of 18F-GP1 to activated platelets in venous and arterial thrombi has already been demonstrated in pre-clinical studies and a phase 1 trial in man.
