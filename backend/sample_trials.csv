This study plan utilizes myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) to explore a) the effects of acute hyperglycemia on myocardial perfusion and coronary flow reserve in individuals with and without DM; and b) the effects of GLP-1 on myocardial perfusion and coronary flow reserve during euglycemia and hyperglycemia in DM. The investigators will recruit individuals with and without DM matched for age, gender and degree of obesity. The investigators will measure myocardial perfusion at rest and during vasodilator stress (to ascertain coronary flow reserve) while subjects are under controlled pancreatic clamp conditions during euglycemia (glucose \~100 mg/dl) and hyperglycemia (glucose \~250 mg/dl) in the presence and absence of concomitant GLP-1 infusion. The investigators believe that the translational significance of their studies is immense, impacting upon both acute and chronic cardiovascular disease manifestations. The effect of glycemic control on cardiovascular outcomes, morbidity and mortality remains an area of active investigation, fueled by the recent conflicting results of several large clinical trials (ACCORD, United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), ADVANCE, VADT). If the investigators find that hyperglycemia is associated with altered myocardial perfusion, the mechanistic implications in the prevention and management of acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases in DM will be groundbreaking. Furthermore, if GLP-1 augments myocardial perfusion (as it does in the peripheral vasculature), the therapeutic benefits for prevention of cardiovascular events in this predisposed population are clear.",33,"* Males and females * Age 40-60 years * BMI\< or = 35 kg/m2 * Diabetic subjects with HbA1c concentrations of \< or = 8%. * Diabetic subjects will be either on diet and lifestyle therapy alone, or monotherapy with metformin or sulphonylureas (except glyburide). * All diabetic subjects should be on stable dose oral agent therapy for 3 months prior to enrollment.","* Subjects with cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease. * Subjects with suspected or overt autonomic neuropathy. * Diabetic subject on thiazolidinediones, insulin, GLP-1 based therapies (exenatide or sitagliptin), alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, glyburide or combination antidiabetic drug therapies. * Diabetics with microalbuminuria.",True,ALL,40 Years,60 Years,ADULT,United States

NCT04065165,Lanreotide Combined With Telotristat Ethyl or Placebo for the First-line Treatment in Patients With Advanced Well Differentiated Small Intestinal Neuroendocrine Tumours (siNET) With Highly-functioning Carcinoid Syndrome,Randomized Phase III Clinical Trial of Lanreotide Combined With Telotristat Ethyl or Placebo for the First-line Treatment in Patients With Advanced Well Differentiated Small Intestinal Neuroendocrine Tumours (siNET) With Highly-functioning Carcinoid Syndrome,WITHDRAWN,2020-04,2027-10,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,Small Intestinal NET; Carcinoid Heart Disease,Telotristat Ethyl; Lanreotide,Number of bowel movements (BMs),"This is a randomized phase III clinical trial of Lanreotide combined with Telotristat ethyl or placebo for the first-line treatment in patients with advanced well differentiated small intestinal neuroendocrine tumours (siNET) with highly-functioning carcinoid syndrome to test whether telotristat ethyl plus lanreotide is more effective than placebo plus lanreotide in reducing the number of daily bowel movements.

In addition, the study allows evaluation of the biochemical response (5-HIAA and chromogranin-A), the reduction in the number of daily cutaneous flushing episodes, the improvement in abdominal pain/discomfort, health-related quality of life, improvement in gastro-intestinal and endocrine symptoms, changes in emotional functioning, the impact of discontinuation of telotristat ethyl/placebo on HRQOL and symptoms, and the safety and toxicity of the treatment.

Patients will enter into a screening/run-in period of 1 week to establish baseline characteristics and symptomatology. The baseline assessment of daily bowel movement, as assessed in an electronic diary, will be averaged over the run-in period.

Following the screening/run-in period, patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either the control arm or the experimental arm for 12 months. Randomization will be stratified according to the grade of tumour differentiation (grade 1 vs. grade 2) and by baseline number of bowel movements per day (4-6 versus \>6). A total of 94 patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either arm.

Upon randomization, all patients will enter the 12-month treatment period with lanreotide + telotristat ethyl/placebo (blinded). In the experimental arm, patients will receive the deep subcutaneous injection of lanreotide (120 mg) every 28 days and 250 mg orally three times daily (TID) of telotristat ethyl for 12 months. In the control arm, patients will receive the deep subcutaneous injection of lanreotide every 28 days (120 mg) and placebo orally TID for 12 months.

After completion of a minimum of 6 months on randomized blinded-treatment, the protocol allows for patients on treatment with telotristat ethyl/placebo to be unblinded in the event of ""lack of symptom control"". Unblinding due to ""lack of symptom control"" can happen at any time between 6 and 12 months of the blinded-treatment period. After unblinding, patient will interrupt protocol treatment and will be further treated as per clinician discretion.

All patients will be unblinded after a maximum of 12 months on randomized blinded-treatment.

After a follow-up of 12 months, patients will go off study except patients with carcinoid heart disease. Patients off study will be further treated as per clinician discretion.

Patients with carcinoid heart disease will continue open-label treatment on study (lanreotide + telotristat ethyl or lanreotide alone according to what they were receiving at unblinding at 12 months) for 4 additional years (open-label extension period). Patients with carcinoid heart disease who discontinue protocol treatment before 12 months will also enter the extension period for additional follow-up. Additional follow-up will last 4 years for these patients and will include 6-monthly cardiological assessments.
